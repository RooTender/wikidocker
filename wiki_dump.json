weather for safety they were often close together great civilizations like the ancient egyptians built large temples and structures like the great pyramids of giza the ancient greeks and romans made what we now call classical architecture the romans working over years ago copied the arch from the etruscans who copied it from the mesopotamians a simpler building in hungary classical architecture was formal and it always obeyed laws it used symmetry which really means balance and it used proportion between shapes the golden mean was a rule which said to put it simply if you are making a room or any other thing it will work best if you always make the long side times as long as the short side there are many laws in classical architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be these laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are often used today however today more notice is taken of specific facts such as what wind speeds occur once or twice in a century several bridges have blown down because that was not properly taken into consideration in some parts of the world like india the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces different architectural styles occur in china japan southeast asia africa mexico and central and south america architects in western europe in the middle ages made romanesque architecture then gothic architecture gothic buildings have tall pointed windows and arches many churches have gothic architecture castles were also built at this time in eastern europe churches usually had domes people added their own ideas and decoration to the classical architecture of the past the renaissance brought a return to classical ideas architecture can have many styles such as the curved guggenheim museum in new york city in the late th century with the industrial revolution people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply many factories and mills were built during or after this revolution decades later in the victorian era architects like george fowler jones and decimus burton still followed the gothic style to build new churches up to this point buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller for example the cathedral in ulm germany is over feet tall however building with stone has its limits and building too tall could result in collapse this happened to the beauvais cathedral which was never completed new technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the willis tower in chicago towards the end of the th century with a second industrial revolution steel became much cheaper architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build an example is the eiffel tower in paris buildings can now be built taller than ever before we call them skyscrapers this new technology has made us free from traditional limitations and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated replaced or abandoned cheap strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls especially for office buildings modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies and its beginnings can been seen as early as modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late th century and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then which are sometimes called post modern many of

ionic doric corinthian and composite this is very important to architectural theory classical architecture is any architecture that has features from the ancient greek and roman style of building it is also known as the architecture of classical antiquity many features of classical architecture come from the writing of the roman architect vitruvius different styles of classical architecture might have existed since the carolingian renaissance styles have definitely existed since the italian renaissance classical architecture buildings can be very different but all classical architecture uses the same common design features these features are structural and visual in much of europe and america from the renaissance until world war two classical architecture was very popular and important to architecture it is still important today but less than it has been in history the term classical architecture is also used to talk about any type of architecture that has become a very specific style for example classical chinese architecture or classical mayan architecture the words traditional and vernacular can mean something different to classical or something similar the phrases new classical and neoclassical describe classical architecture that was built in modern times contents history where and when how it changed range of use petrification related pages references history change change source where and when change change source classical architecture comes from the architecture of ancient greece and ancient rome after the west part of the roman empire stopped existing no roman architecture was built in most of western europe in the carolingian renaissance which happened in the th and th centuries people started bringing back classical architecture for example the gatehouse of lorsch abbey c ad in germany looks like the colosseum in rome the colosseum is a very important piece of classical architecture many styles of architecture have features of classical architecture for example byzantine romanesque and gothic architecture but these styles do not try to exactly copy the traditions of classical architecture for example the idea of putting specific spaces between columns so these styles are not thought of as classical architecture how it changed change change source by the time the italian renaissance started gothic architecture was not used much anymore architects such as leon battista alberti sebastiano serlio and giacomo barozzi da vignola started trying to bring back the style of architecture used in ancient rome they did this by reading a paper called de architectura which was written by vitruvius vitruvius was an architect in ancient rome and his paper has a lot of information about classical architecture and its features the architects also looked at the old buildings in rome and italy the classical architecture from the renaissance shows that classical ideas were used in a very specific way some of the ideas they used had no clear origin in ancient architecture for example the ospedale degli innocenti building in florence was built by filippo bruncelleschi and is one of the earliest renaissance buildings it was finished in but the columns on the building do not look exactly like the columns in roman architecture during the renaissance people learned about how ancient buildings were designed the theory of classical architecture they did not look at how every building was designed this means classical architecture is not exactly the same as the old buildings it was based off it is simplified and buildings made after the renaissance follow these simplified rules most of the architecture styles in europe that were used after the renaissance are classical architecture this is a general use of the phrase classical architecture this general use is used by sir john summerson in the classical language of architecture the features of classical architecture have been used in different ways in different styles for example baroque or rococo architecture is different to classical architecture baroque or rococo is based on classical architecture but these styles have their own features that are different to classical architecture when baroque architecture was used people who learned about architecture still learned classical ideas but they were not as important as during the renaissance palladian architecture is a style based on classical architecture it is based on the style of andrea palladio he was an architect from venice his style was important even after he died in britain it was used for many good buildings in the th and th century the style was mixed with the georgian architecture that britain made at the time at around architects began copying classical architecture again they did this because baroque architecture only copied some of classical architecture these architects wanted to make buildings that used all the features of classical architecture the style they made was called neoclassicism new findings in archaeology meant architects knew more about classical architecture than before the architects wanted clear rules for making buildings some of the first neoclassical thinkers were claude perrault marc antoine laugier and carlo lodoli some of the most important neoclassical architects were tienne louis boull e claude nicolas ledoux friedrich gilly and john soane neoclassical architecture was very important from to neo gothic architecture was becoming more important at the same time neo gothic architecture was much less classical than neoclassical in the late th century many styles of architecture were important many of the styles were not like classical architecture for example art nouveau and eclecticism classical architecture was still important sometimes it would become very popular in one area for example nordic classicism was popular in the s but true classical architecture was never as popular as it was during the renaissance when modernism became popular in the early hth century classical architecture mostly stopped being used range of use change change source classical styles were important in america and europe for a long time from the renaissance until modernism began classical architecture was very important this means the architecture of ancient greece and rome was used and changed into most new architecture styles architectural styles can come from classical architecture in different ways for example neo palladian architecture is based on the buildings designed by andrea palladio an architect from the italian renaissance but palladio based his architecture on ancient roman architecture so neo palladian architecture is based on classical architecture even though it is mostly based on the works of palladio some styles are not classical like gothic but they have classical features this means it is hard to judge classical architecture s range of use the most important part of classical architecture is features borrowed from ancient greek and roman architecture and the rules architects made by learning about it petrification change change source petrification is a word used to show how ancient greek builders changed from using wood to using stone it also shows the effect this had on the classical architecture style during the archaic and early classical times th and th centuries bc early temples used a style of classical architecture called doric most historians think that the oldest temples were made with wood then the most important features of the buildings were used to make new buildings this meant the style was the same and all the buildings followed the same rules after that in greece stone was used instead of wood but they used the same style because the style was petrified and kept the same the word petrification is used to show this the greeks wanted the buildings to look the same as they did when they were made of wood historians think this had a religious reason nobody knows why exactly because it was so long ago many places still used wood for example the etruscans in italy even though the etruscans used some greek culture and religion they mostly kept using wood the etruscans knew how to use stone but they didn t they only started using stone when they became roman", "constructivism from simple english wikipedia the free encyclopedia

has been used in many different ways at different times but there are some things in common postmodernism says that there is no real truth it says that knowledge is always made or invented and not discovered because knowledge is made by people a person cannot know something with certainty all ideas and facts are believed instead of known people believe that they know what the truth is but they will think that the truth is something different later this is the opposite of objectivity which says that the truth is always there and people have to discover it since postmodernism says that the truth is just a thing that people invent people can believe different things and think it is the truth and all be right postmodernism says that one person should not try to make another person believe what he believes because it means nothing to say that one belief is right and the other is wrong postmodernism says that if somebody has a belief and tries to make somebody else believe it also it means that they are just trying to have power over them starting with the th century enlightenment and into the early th century many people believed that science and new knowledge would make the world better when scientists or philosophers discovered something new it would always make society a little bit better they thought that social progress could not be stopped modernism especially believed this but postmodernism says that there is no real social progress it says that while some things about the world change people only want to believe that the world is better than it was it changes but does not get better because there is no better postmodernism says that since peoples opinions change and since one person s opinion cannot be more right than another it means nothing to say that for example one work of art is better than any other postmodernism says that art music and literature for example can be anything that its maker says that it is postmodern art and literature

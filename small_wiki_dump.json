to become an architect there were architects long before there was higher education they learnt by being an apprentice to an established architect architecture can do small designs such as for a garage or large designs such as for a whole city the capital cities of bras lia and canberra were designed architecture often overlaps with structural engineering and architects and engineers often work together in the past people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather for safety they were often close together great civilizations like the ancient egyptians built large temples and structures like the great pyramids of giza the ancient greeks and romans made what we now call classical architecture the romans working over years ago copied the arch from the etruscans who copied it from the mesopotamians classical architecture was formal and it always obeyed laws it used symmetry which really means balance and it used proportion between shapes the golden mean was a rule which said to put it simply if you are making a room or any other thing it will work best if you always make the long side times as long as the short side there are many laws in classical architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be these laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are often used today however today more notice is taken of specific facts such as what wind speeds occur once or twice in a century several bridges have blown down because that was not properly taken into consideration in some parts of the world like india the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces different architectural styles occur in china japan southeast asia africa mexico and central and south america architects in western europe in the middle ages made romanesque architecture then gothic architecture gothic buildings have tall pointed windows and arches many churches have gothic architecture castles were also built at this time in eastern europe churches usually had domes people added their own ideas and decoration to the classical architecture of the past the renaissance brought a return to classical ideas in the late th century with the industrial revolution people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply many factories and mills were built during or after this revolution decades later in the victorian era architects like george fowler jones and decimus burton still followed the gothic style to build new churches up to this point buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller for example the cathedral in ulm germany is over feet tall however building with stone has its limits and building too tall could result in collapse this happened to the beauvais cathedral which was never completed towards the end of the th century with a second industrial revolution steel became much cheaper architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build an example is the eiffel tower in paris buildings can now be built taller than ever before we call them skyscrapers this new technology has made us free from traditional limitations and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated replaced or abandoned cheap strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls especially for office buildings modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies and its beginnings can been seen as early as modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late th century and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then which are sometimes called post modern many of the world s greatest structures were built by modern day architects such as frank lloyd

features from the ancient greek and roman style of building it is also known as the architecture of classical antiquity many features of classical architecture come from the writing of the roman architect vitruvius different styles of classical architecture might have existed since the carolingian renaissance styles have definitely existed since the italian renaissance classical architecture buildings can be very different but all classical architecture uses the same common design features these features are structural and visual in much of europe and america from the renaissance until world war two classical architecture was very popular and important to architecture it is still important today but less than it has been in history the term classical architecture is also used to talk about any type of architecture that has become a very specific style for example classical chinese architecture or classical mayan architecture the words traditional and vernacular can mean something different to classical or something similar the phrases new classical and neoclassical describe classical architecture that was built in modern times classical architecture comes from the architecture of ancient greece and ancient rome after the west part of the roman empire stopped existing no roman architecture was built in most of western europe in the carolingian renaissance which happened in the th and th centuries people started bringing back classical architecture for example the gatehouse of lorsch abbey c ad in germany looks like the colosseum in rome the colosseum is a very important piece of classical architecture many styles of architecture have features of classical architecture for example byzantine romanesque and gothic architecture but these styles do not try to exactly copy the traditions of classical architecture for example the idea of putting specific spaces between columns so these styles are not thought of as classical architecture by the time the italian renaissance started gothic architecture was not used much anymore architects such as leon battista alberti sebastiano serlio and giacomo barozzi da vignola started trying to bring back the style of architecture used in ancient rome they did this by reading a paper called de architectura which was written by vitruvius vitruvius was an architect in ancient rome and his paper has a lot of information about classical architecture and its features the architects also looked at the old buildings in rome and italy the classical architecture from the renaissance shows that classical ideas were used in a very specific way some of the ideas they used had no clear origin in ancient architecture for example the ospedale degli innocenti building in florence was built by filippo bruncelleschi and is one of the earliest renaissance buildings it was finished in but the columns on the building do not look exactly like the columns in roman architecture during the renaissance people learned about how ancient buildings were designed the theory of classical architecture they did not look at how every building was designed this means classical architecture is not exactly the same as the old buildings it was based off it is simplified and buildings made after the renaissance follow these simplified rules most of the architecture styles in europe that were used after the renaissance are classical architecture this is a general use of the phrase classical architecture this general use is used by sir john summerson in the classical language of architecture the features of classical architecture have been used in different ways in different styles for example baroque or rococo architecture is different to classical architecture baroque or rococo is based on classical architecture but these styles have their own features that are different to classical architecture when baroque architecture was used people who learned about architecture still learned classical ideas but they were not as important as during the renaissance palladian architecture is a style based on classical architecture it is based on the style of andrea palladio he was an architect from venice his style was important even after he died in britain it was used for many good buildings in the th and th century the style was mixed with the georgian architecture that britain made at the time at around architects began copying classical architecture again they did this because baroque architecture only copied some of classical architecture these architects wanted to make buildings that used all the features of classical architecture the style they made was called neoclassicism new findings in archaeology meant architects knew more about classical architecture than before the architects wanted clear rules for making buildings some of the first neoclassical thinkers were claude perrault marc antoine laugier and carlo lodoli some of the most important neoclassical architects were tienne louis boull e claude nicolas ledoux friedrich gilly and john soane neoclassical architecture was very important from to neo gothic architecture was becoming more important at the same time neo gothic architecture was much less classical than neoclassical in the late th century many styles of architecture were important many of the styles were not like classical architecture for example art nouveau and eclecticism classical architecture was still important sometimes it would become very popular in one area for example nordic classicism was popular in the s but true classical architecture was never as popular as it was during the renaissance when modernism became popular in the early hth century classical architecture mostly stopped being used classical styles were important in america and europe for a long time from the renaissance until modernism began classical architecture was very important this means the architecture of ancient greece and rome was used and changed into most new architecture styles architectural styles can come from classical architecture in different ways for example neo palladian architecture is based on the buildings designed by andrea palladio an architect from the italian renaissance but palladio based his architecture on ancient roman architecture so neo palladian architecture is based on classical architecture even though it is mostly based on the works of palladio some styles are not classical like gothic but they have classical features this means it is hard to judge classical architecture s range of use the most important part of classical architecture is features borrowed from ancient greek and roman architecture and the rules architects made by learning about it petrification is a word used to show how ancient greek builders changed from using wood to using stone it also shows the effect this had on the classical architecture style during the archaic and early classical times th and th centuries bc early temples used a style of classical architecture called doric most historians think that the oldest temples were made with wood then the most important features of the buildings were used to make new buildings this meant the style was the same and all the buildings followed the same rules after that in greece stone was used instead of wood but they used the same style because the style was petrified and kept the same the word petrification is used to show this the greeks wanted the buildings to look the same as they did when they were made of wood historians think this had a religious reason nobody knows why exactly because it was so long ago many places still used wood for example the etruscans in italy even though the etruscans used some greek culture and religion they mostly kept using wood the etruscans knew how to use stone but they didn t they only started using stone when they became roman", " constructivism was an artistic and architectural movement that originated

truth is something different later this is the opposite of objectivity which says that the truth is always there and people have to discover it since postmodernism says that the truth is just a thing that people invent people can believe different things and think it is the truth and all be right postmodernism says that one person should not try to make another person believe what he believes

get better because there is no better postmodernism says that since peoples opinions change and since one person s opinion cannot be more right than another it means nothing to say that for example

emergency communication system ecs is any type of system often using computers that lets people or groups communicate during emergencies these systems often include many different types of technology such as telephones and televisions which all work together to help communicate important messages during emergencies an emergency notification system can send messages in just one direction from the sender to the person or group that receives the message text message services like twitter automatic telephone services like reverse and the common town siren systems that are used to warn people about tornadoes and other problems are all examples of emergency notification systems emergency communication systems often include notification abilities but will also include two way communications so people and groups can talk back and forth to each other another meaning about the phrase emergency communication systems might be that the sender can give more information about an emergency it can also mean that the sender can tell people what do to because of the emergency the phrase emergency notification system might mean that the sender can only tell people or groups about the emergency maybe without many details too there can be many different words and phrases that different people use instead of emergency communication system but most times they are talking about the same idea for example the phrases emergency communications and emergency telecommunications may talk about the same thing emergencies can make communications difficult communicating during emergencies can be very different than communicating during normal times when emergencies happen many things about the situation can change suddenly because of that an emergency communication system should be able to do many special things often popular communication tools for example email are not fast enough or they can not be used in every place every emergency situation can be very different and difficult to predict so a good emergency communication system must be able to work for every situation an emergency according to the merriam webster dictionary is a surprising event or group of events that needs very quick actions because of that it should be very important that any communication about an emergency be well timed and quick so things will not be damaged or people killed for example during the virginia tech massacre about two hours had passed before the first communication an email was sent to workers and students and by that time the person who was using the gun had already went into a building where he was going to begin his attack in that case it was not until about twenty minutes after the violence began that a loudspeaker announcement was made for people to hide in many situations it s likely clear that just seconds and minutes are the most important for communicating during emergencies during an emergency users need to quickly and easily send their messages and they need to be able to do it so that they are sure it succeeds and with a secure and easy to use interface that can be used from any location an emergency communication system that can be used by normal people will be successfully used and managed during emergencies which can sometimes cause people to die campus managers must be able to react to the emergency and start the alert system quickly but sending emergency warnings is probably one of the most uncommon and unfamiliar things to do so it s most important that a system be easy to use but even though a good emergency communication system must be easy to use its technology should be very advanced and complex it should be advanced because that is needed in order to make sure many different things can work together to create and send emergency communications in many possible ways the important thing though is that an advanced system should still be easy for someone to use for both emergency and normal communications the ability to use a system for normal communications is also important so the operator who paid for the system can get the most value it is also important so that people can be familiar enough with the system that they can use it during a stressful emergency situation in general the lower the cost of buying installing and maintaining an emergency communication systems is the more popular such systems may become in society and the more common these systems are the more likely it is that these systems will be available to help during emergencies in more locations more important than just helping with emergency response modern mass notification systems have become a valuable thing to have for everyday non emergency communications being able to use an emergency communication system for both kinds of communications lets the owner of the system get the most value an obvious need for any modern emergency communication system is that instead of just giving warnings it must also be able to give clear instructions about what to do because of the emergency the rehabilitation engineering research center for wireless technologies found that no matter what type of warning was first sent another second type of warning was needed before people would trust the warning and do something because of it a system that is able to give warnings in many different ways may save lives and stop an emergency from being too terrible emergencies often require delivery of different versions of the same message at the same time for example in an armed hostage taking emergency the people inside a building may need to get instructions to lock the door while police and other people may need to be aware that all of the doors could be locked and other information so they can decide what to do using that some of the more modern emergency communication systems such as siemens sygnal or messagenet connections say that they can send a single message at one time that gives full details to first responders while customizing that same message to give more simple instructions to lock doors to the people inside the building by using a single message that divides the content between types of users fewer messages have to be created and sent which may also save time there should be multiple ways of sending emergency information so that if one does not work the others might also research shows that people will check more than one communication method before they take action the public expects to be contacted in many different ways besides phone calls and emails people also expect to be reached by text messaging and fax also the public may look to social media for example facebook and twitter as another way to receive messages and check for updates the partnership for public warning states a single warning is frequently insufficient to move people to action especially if it cannot be confirmed by direct observation for most people the first warning received captures their attention and triggers a search for corroboration but cannot be relied on to elicit the desired behavior scientific research supports the common sense observation that people are disinclined to risk being fooled by a single alarm that might prove false or accidental effective warning requires the coordinated use of multiple channels of communication this basically means that when people get a first warning they want to look for more information about the emergency before they do anything about it by having many ways which all work together of sending a warning people will be more likely to react to it in the best way to help many of these properties an emergency communication system should be able to connect to and communicate with other related systems the partnership for public warning states that a basic problem is that many parts of existing warning systems do not work together because of that whenever a warning is sent it often takes a lot of time and effort also there are multiple ways that an emergency communication system might receive an original warning one example of this might be a building s fire control system sending a notice that a smoke detector has found smoke an emergency communication system that was built the right way should be able to receive that notice and turn it into a message that the people in the building can understand and use to decide what to do in order to save lives and property another example might be of the national weather service sending a severe weather warning for example by using rss in this example the emergency communication system should be able to turn that warning into a message and send it in a similar way as the smoke detector example so people will know what to do the ability to work together should also include old and new technology introducing a new system that cannot work with older existing equipment can cause problems an emergency communication system may be a product that is owned by the organization using it for example a paging network for a hospital or it may be a service that is owned by a third party for example a cellular carrier s network each has good and bad properties however services have some major problems for emergency communications even though many people think differently using sms as one example due to the way cellular networks are built text messaging services would not be able to send a large number of communications in a short amount of time making sms service a poor emergency communication method property based on premise emergency communication systems are those which are mainly or completely in the same location or area as it serves while off property non premise based emergency communication systems are those which are in a different location or area there are good and bad properties of each often non premise based systems are slower than systems that are premise based because the different locations need to be connected using data networks for example the internet with the growth of populations and the change of technology the ways that emergencies are communicated have also changed in america s early years common ways of communicating emergencies may have been mostly ringing church bells or people sending messages by riding horses later as technology developed the telegraph became an almost instant way of communicating after that radio communications telephones and sirens became common after the surprise attack on pearl harbor by the japanese in civil defense sirens became popular and were used in many military bases and towns across america a weakness of these systems is that they were not really able to tell people what they should do today modern communication tools such as smartphones flat panel digital signage gps and computer speech among many others are changing how people are notified about emergencies with these more modern tools there is an ability to provide more specific instructions so that instead of just notifying people about an emergency it is now possible to give exact instructions on what to do because of the emergency also those instructions may even be customized for those peoples special situation and location for example smart phones may have gps that would allow a map to be shown of safe areas and perhaps directions for getting there such a map might be different depending on where the person is currently at in a good system all of these special warnings and instructions could be sent with just a single alert ", " graphics from greek are visual presentations on some surface such as a wall canvas

century johannes gutenberg improved the process he used separate alloy letters screwed into a frame this way a large set of letters could make almost any page for printing this process was called

communications signal processing and in electrical engineering more generally a signal is any time varying quantity the concept is broad and hard to define precisely definitions specific to subfields are common for example in information theory a signal is a codified message i e the sequence of states in a communications channel that encodes a message in a communications system a transmitter encodes a message into a signal which is carried to a receiver by the communications channel for example the words mary had a little lamb might be the message spoken into a telephone the telephone transmitter converts the sounds into an electrical voltage signal the signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires and at the receiver it is reconverted into sounds shannon c e a

of interest include sound images biological signals such as ecg radar signals and many others processing of such signals includes storage and reconstruction separation of information from noise e g aircraft identification by radar compression e g image compression and feature extraction e g converting text to speech for analog signals signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunication for digital signals signal processing may involve the compression error checking and error detection of digital signals signal processing is the analysis interpretation and manipulation of acquired signals acquired signals must to be processed depending on the purpose of measurement a method of measurement and a property of acquired signals when signals are processed statistics is used because it s essential to know a distribution of data and represent data by numerical formulas in other words to study signal processing it s demanded to study statistics like the theory of error the arithmetical mean probability a stochastic variable accuracy and detailed drawing etc in most cases signals are regular as it is acquired from electric instruments like telemeter or communications equipment etc but there are also many accidentally occurred irregular signals which make it difficult to find formulas that fit exactly here the irregular means it s hard to predict the result which is not yet occurred when irregular signals are acquired photon is necessary so it is measured and calculated", " silent trade or barter is when traders who do not speak each other s language trade without talking to each other this was used in many parts of ancient africa silent bartering was used during a d to a d and probably had a much longer history to do a silent barter one group of traders would go to a certain place leaving whatever they are offering to trade the other group of traders would then decide if they would like to accept the goods usually salt or gold that were left if the goods met with approval the second group would then take the goods leave their own goods in return and leave because the person accepted the offer this system of trading was used mostly in ancient ghana the popular things they sold were gold and salt another system was face to face trading using hand signals gold mined south of the sahel was traded pound for pound for salt mined in the desert the salt from the desert was needed by the people of sahel to flavor and preserve their food and gold has always had value for adornment wearing because of this trade cities grew and flourished and parts of west africa became commercial centers west africa produced gold until about ad", " an sms or short messaging service is a type of communication used in mobile phones they are more commonly called text messages with sms someone can send text to another person sms can be slow as a network gives priority to phone calls and only carries text messages after calls are handled there is also a limit of characters that a text message can send longer messages than this will be sent as multiple messages where the sender has to pay for each individual message text messages are often sent between phone users when an actual phone call is not wanted or needed for example they may be used in a situation where silence is needed or to send something private that one person does not want people near them to hear message price depends on the phone network of the user some mobile phone plans allow for unlimited texting ", " subtitles are text like versions of the dialog in movies subtitles are also used in television programmes and video games the text is usually displayed at the

integrity for communications over tcp ip networks such as the internet several versions of the protocols are common in applications such as web browsing electronic mail internet faxing instant messaging and voice over ip voip the tls protocol allows applications to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping tampering and message forgery tls provides endpoint authentication and communications confidentiality over the internet using cryptography most of the time only the server is authenticated i e its identity is ensured while the client remains unauthenticated this means that the end user whether an individual or an application such as a web browser can be sure with whom it is communicating the next level of security is known as mutual authentication mutual authentication requires public key infrastructure pki deployment to clients unless tls psk or the secure remote password srp protocol are used which provide strong mutual

page typography was born when print was born early types were based on the letterforms of scribes and the letters cut into trajan s column monumental inscriptions later gradually type designs were based on the special needs of books pamphlets newspapers and advertisements typography includes not only letters but all the set of symbols in a font and it includes the overall design of a page or document it applies to any medium which may be read therefore it includes text on computer screens a typographer may design type select fonts and design the layout of pages and books the term does not cover the act of printing itself though many of the early printers were themselves typographers typography in the th century was greatly influenced by three things a traditional aim of the typographer would be to produce a page which is above all legible and attractive to read without its being obtrusive for display typography such as advertising the display must be noticed before it is read this had led to the development of many display typefaces which are highly visible and which are available in large sizes", " in mathematics the universe of discourse or domain of discourse is a set of all

electricity the flow of electrons and how to use that to build things like computers it uses circuits that are made with parts called components and connecting wires to do useful things the science behind electronics comes from the study of physics and gets applied in real life ways through the field of electrical engineering many people can name several simple electronic components such as transistors fuses circuit breakers batteries motors transformers leds and bulbs but as the number of components starts to increase it often helps to think in terms of smaller systems or blocks which can be connected together to do something useful one way of looking at an electronic system is to separate it into three parts a television set for example has as its input a broadcast signal received from an antenna or for cable television a cable signal processing circuits inside the television set use the brightness colour and sound information contained in the received signal to control the television set s output devices the display output device may be a cathode ray tube crt or a plasma or liquid crystal display screen the audio output device might be a magnetically driven audio speaker the display output devices convert the signal processing circuits brightness and colour information into the visible image displayed on a screen the audio output device converts the processed sound information into sounds that can be heard by listeners analysis of a circuit network involves knowing the input and the signal processing circuit and finding out the output knowing the input and output and finding out or designing the signal processing part is called synthesis people started experimenting with electricity as early as b c e when thales of miletus discovered rubbing fur on amber would cause them to attract each other starting in the s devices used glass or metal vacuum tubes to control the flow of electricity with these components a low power voltage can be used to change another this revolutionized radio and allowed other inventions in the s and early s transistors and semiconductor began replacing vacuum tubes transistors can be made much smaller than vacuum tubes and they can work using less energy at about the same time integrated circuits circuits that are integrated inside other circuits became commonly used integrated circuits made it possible to reduce the number of parts needed to make electronic products and made the products much cheaper in general analog circuits are used for signals that have a range of amplitudes in general analog circuits measure or control the amplitude of signals in the early days of electronics all electronic devices used analog circuits the frequency of the analog circuit is often measured or controlled in analog signal processing even though more digital circuits are made analog circuits will always be necessary since the world and its people work in analog ways pulse circuits are used for signals that require rapid pulses of energy for example radar works by using pulse circuits to create and send high powered bursts of radio energy from radar transmitters radar antennas are used to send transmit the high powered bursts in the direction the antenna is pointed the radar transmitter s pulses or bursts of radio energy hit and bounce back they are reflected from hard and metallic objects hard objects are things like buildings hills and mountains big things made of metal include aircraft bridges or even objects in space like satellites the reflected radar energy is detected by radar pulse receivers which use both pulse and digital circuits together the pulse and digital circuits in radar pulse receivers are used to show the location and distance of objects which have reflected the radar transmitter s high powered pulses by controlling how often the rapid pulses of radar energy are sent out by a radar transmitter called the transmitter s pulse timing and how long it takes for the reflected pulse energy to come back to the radar receiver one can tell not only where objects are but also how far away they are digital circuits in a radar receiver calculate the distance to an object by knowing the time interval between energy pulses the radar receiver s digital circuits count how long it takes between pulses for an object s reflected energy to be detected by the radar receiver since radar pulses are sent and received at approximately the speed of light the distance to an object can easily be calculated this is done in digital circuits by multiplying the speed of light by the time it takes to receive the radar energy reflected back from an object the time between pulses often called pulse rate time or prt sets the limit on how far away an object can be detected that distance is called the range of a radar transmitter and receiver radar transmitters and receivers use long prt s to find the distance to objects that are far away long prt s makes it possible to accurately determine the distance to the moon for example fast prt s are used to detect objects that are much closer like ships at sea high flying aircraft or to determine the speed of fast moving automobiles on highways digital circuits are used for signals that only turn on and off instead of often working at levels somewhere between on and off active components in digital circuits typically have one signal level when turned on and another signal level when turned off in general in digital circuits a component is only switched on and off computers and electronic clocks

used for filming an event in a way that people watching the film feel like they are looking from the eyes of person who are doing activities in the event themselves first person perspective while action camera is made for filming it can also take pictures all films and pictures it took will be kept on a tiny card that you can pull them out and watch them later action camera is made to be small and very light so that a person who wear it does not feel its weight while doing his or her things and it usually uses wide angle lens to film as many details around as possible inside the camera there is a battery that lasts long enough for you to film for few hours action camera is also made to be stronger than normal video camera so that it keeps filming even when the wearing person moves at high speed or crashes into something camera sellers usually give you a hard clear plastic box that fits with the camera when you buy it when they do you should store the camera in this box every time you are going to film something this box will have holes a belt or a metal rod which you can use for tying it to a person or screwing it on an object that person wears usually a helmet some kind of these boxes can stop water from coming into it when closed so you may use them to film under water without breaking the camera as well", " an alarm is something used to alert people quickly to

musical instrument such as an electric guitar or an electric bass guitar louder and stronger amplifiers are also hidden in any electronic thing that makes sound with loudspeakers this includes televisions radios computers and mp players to name a few amplifiers ability to use low impedance speakers may vary typical impedance is ohms classification can be done by current loss when amplifier is on but does not get signal example a class amplifier takes more current without signal than b class amplifier but a class amplifier have smaller distortion there is also several distortion types electronic amplifiers make a signal from the radio or electric instrument louder and stronger by using transistors or vacuum tubes electronic amplifiers have to be connected to electrical current or a battery to work once the signal from the radio or electric instrument has been made louder and stronger the signal needs to be connected to a loudspeaker so that people can hear it when an amplifier tries to make the sound louder than it can it adds distortion to the sound some amplifiers are made to add controlled distortion distortion from transistors sounds different than distortion from tubes distortion from tubes is often said to be more musical because of all this more expensive amplifiers often add controlled distortion with tubes many of these amplifiers use transistors for a clean sound without distortion from the s until the s electronic amplifiers used vacuum tubes however electronic amplifiers with vacuum tubes were heavy and they produced a lot of heat they also broke down a lot since the s most electronic amplifiers have been built with transistors transistors are lighter cheaper and more reliable", " an analog or analogue signal is any continuous signal the difference from a digital signal is that also very small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful when one speaks of analog one often means an electrical context however mechanical pneumatic hydraulic and other systems may also convey analog signals an analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal s information any information may be conveyed by an analog signal often such a signal is a measured change in physical phenomena such as sound light temperature position or pressure for example in sound recording changes in air pressure that is to say sound strike the diaphragm of a microphone which causes related changes in a voltage or the current in an electric circuit the voltage or the current is said to be an analog of the sound see digital for a discussion of digital vs analog", " bandwidth is used to measure electronic and other types of communication this includes radio electronics and other forms of electromagnetic radiation bandwidth is the difference between the electronic signal having highest frequency and the signal having the lowest frequency in computer networks bandwidth is often used as a term for the data transfer bit rate more easily the amount of data that is carried or passed from one point to another in a network in a given time period usually a second many systems work by means of continuous movements or oscillations each complete back and forth it makes is called a cycle the number of cycles every second is its frequency frequency is measured in cycles per second most often called hertz or hz for short systems have at least one frequency and usually many different frequencies for example sound waves travel as vibrations people can hear sound frequencies low as hz and high as hz a band of frequencies is a continuous range of frequencies the band of frequencies people can hear is from hz to hz bandwidth is the width of a frequency band the width is the highest frequency minus the lowest frequency in the hearing example the bandwidth of a person s ears is about hz hz hz bandwidth is used with electromagnetic spectrum for example radio waves light waves and x rays such waves are oscillations of electric and magnetic fields for example the lowest united states am radio channel has the band of frequencies from hz to hz it has a bandwidth of hz all united states am radio broadcasting stations have this bandwidth but the location of each band is distinct the lowest united states fm radio channel has the band from hz mhz to hz mhz it has a bandwidth of khz you can see that the width of an fm band is times the width of an am band the word bandwidth has been used incorrectly in digital data communication to mean data carrying capacity there is no such thing as digital bandwidth the proper term for the data carrying capacity of a communication channel is channel capacity in general the channel capacity of a system increases with the bandwidth used for communication however many other parts are also important therefore in most systems the channel capacity is different from the channel bandwidth", " a barcode reader or barcode scanner is an electronic device which is able to scan and decode barcodes these devices use optical technology such as infrared light some readers use an integrated decoder others have one unit for reading the barcode and another one to decode the barcode a barcode reader also called a price scanner or point of sale pos scanner is a hand held or stationary input device used to capture and read information contained in a bar code a barcode reader consists of a scanner a decoder either built in or external and a cable used to connect the reader with a computer because a barcode reader merely captures and translates the barcode into numbers and or letters the data must be sent to a computer so that a software application can make sense of the data barcode scanners can be connected to a computer through a serial port keyboard port or an interface device called a wedge a barcode reader works by directing a beam of light across the bar code and measuring the amount of light that is reflected back the dark bars on a barcode reflect less light than the white spaces between them the scanner converts the light energy into electrical energy which is then converted into data by the decoder and forwarded to a computer there are five basic kinds of barcode readers pen wands slot scanners charge couple device ccd scanners image scanners and laser scanners a pen wand is the simplest barcode reader it contains no moving parts and is known for its durability and low cost a pen wand can present a challenge to the user however because it has to remain in direct contact with the bar code must be held at a certain angle and has to be moved over the bar code at a certain speed a slot scanner remains stationary and the item with the bar code on it is pulled by hand through the slot slot scanners are typically used to scan bar codes on identification cards a ccd scanner has a better read range than the pen wand and is often used in retail sales typically a ccd scanner has a gun type interface and has to be held no more than one inch from the bar code each time the bar code is scanned several readings are taken to reduce the possibility of errors a disadvantage of the ccd scanner is that it cannot read a bar code that is wider than its input face an image scanner also called a camera reader uses a small video camera to capture an image of the bar code and then uses sophisticated digital image processing techniques to decode the bar code it can read a bar code from about to inches away and generally costs less than a laser scanner a laser scanner either hand held or stationary does not have to be close to the bar code in order to do its job it uses a system of mirrors and lenses to allow the scanner to read the bar code regardless of orientation and can easily read a bar code up to inches away to reduce the possibility of errors a laser scanning may perform up to scans per second specialized long range laser scanners are capable of reading a bar code up to feet away", " biasing in electronics is using

circuits instead of using soldering to connect wires and components together like on a perfboard or printed circuit board they can be stuck into the holes of the breadboard it has metal strips inside that will connect them and it lets them be removed easily or moved around when testing a circuit the rows and columns of holes on a breadboard are usually labelled with numbers and letters everything in a row with the same number will be connected except if the breadboard has a strip down the center in that case the metal is split and the row has two separate connections one on each side the center strip is also useful when connecting integrated circuits because they can be pushed in over the top of it and have legs connecting to both sides without overlapping the connections or gauge wire usually work best to plug into the holes in a breadboard ", " a cartridge means an object that adds different functions or content to an electronic device like a video game cartridge or that

billions are in use some even in outer space early people used candles and oil lamps for light crude incandescent lights were made in the early and middle th century but had little use improved vacuum pumps and better materials made them shine longer and brighter late in the century electric power stations brought electricity to urban and later rural areas to power them later gas discharge lights including fluorescent lights use less electricity to make more light there are several kinds of light bulbs light bulbs convert electricity into light and heat except for heat lamps the heat is considered waste a light bulb that produces more light and less heat is more efficient the incandescent light bulb turns electricity into light by sending the electric current through a thin wire called a filament electrical filaments are made up mostly of tungsten metal the resistance of the filament heats the bulb eventually the filament gets so hot that it glows producing light the filament needs to be protected from the air so it is inside the bulb and the air in the bulb is either removed a vacuum or more often replaced with a noble gas that doesn t affect anything like neon or argon only about of the energy that goes into an incandescent light bulb actually makes light the rest makes heat that s one of the reasons led s are more efficient this type of light bulb worked poorly and was little used until joseph swan and thomas edison improved it in the s it was the first light bulb that could be used in houses it did not cost too much and it worked well for the first time people did not need a fire candles oil lamps kerosene lamps etc to make light it was bright enough to let people read easily at night or do work it was used to light stores and streets and people could travel after dark this started the common use of electricity in homes and businesses they had carbon filaments until tungsten ones were developed in the s they last longer and make a brighter light early vacuum tube devices were incandescent bulbs made to operate at lower temperatures with added electronic parts fluorescent lamps are efficient and only give off the amount of heat of an incandescent they also last longer than incandescent but until the late th century were much bigger and did not fit into sockets for small overhead lights and lamps like an incandescent could a fluorescent bulb is a glass tube usually filled with argon gas and a little bit of mercury when turned on the cathode heats up and sends out electrons these hit the argon gas and the mercury the argon gas makes a plasma which lets the electrons move around better when the electrons hit a mercury atom it puts the molecule into a state where it has a lot of energy stores the energy the energetic state doesn t last very long and when the energy is released it lets out a photon photons from mercury are not visible like some other photons they are ultraviolet so there s a phosphor coating on the wall of the bulb when the photon hits a phosphor molecule it in turn puts that molecule into an excited state when this phosphor releases energy it lets out a photon that we can see and light is made changing the type of phosphor can change the color we see but usually fluorescent light bulbs are whiter than incandescent light bulbs which are slightly yellow an led also known as light emitting diode is made like electronics it s a chip of semiconducting material led bulbs are more efficient and last much longer than either incandescent or fluorescent bulbs unlike fluorescent bulbs leds do

components together these are used in almost all computers and electronics today the card is made of a material that does not conduct electricity usually fiberglass usually copper is etched set in thin lines inside the board between the layers of fiberglass or on the surface of the board this makes the electricity go only where it is wanted electronic components are then attached to this board using a metal to conduct electricity the metal etched into the board allows electricity to travel from one component to another in electrical circuits boards can have many different parts which are connected and work together the most common circuit boards are made in large numbers for a specific job for example to run a computer a mobile cell phone or a television some circuit boards are made

that are made thin enough and of the right material to flex bend rigid flex boards are those that combine the features of the rigid boards and flex boards hard at some points and blendable st some other points printed circuit boards came from electrical connection systems that were used in the s originally metal strips or rods were used to connect large electric components mounted on wooden bases later the metal strips were replaced by wires connected to screw terminals and wooden bases were replaced by metal frames this let things be smaller which was needed as circuits became more complex with more parts thomas edison tested methods of using metals on linen paper arthur berry in patented a print and etch method in britain in charles ducas of the united states developed a method using electroplating he created an electrical path directly on an insulated surface by printing through a stencil a shape cut into a board or paper with special ink that could conduct electricity just

layer of copper foil attached to a hard base that did not conduct electricity eisler s technique was noticed by the us military and they started to use it in new weapons including proximity fuzes in world war ii his idea became very useful in the s when the transistor was introduced up to that point vacuum tubes and other components were so large that the traditional mounting and wiring methods were all that was needed with the introduction of transistors however the components became very small and manufacturers needed to use printed circuit boards so the connections could also be small plated through hole technology and its use in multi layer pcbs were patented by the u s firm hazeltine in this allowed much more complex boards with components placed closely together integrated circuit chips were introduced in the s and these components were quickly incorporated into printed circuit board design and manufacturing techniques today the printed circuit board can have up to

go normally there is a design or schematic that will be turned into a pcb there is no such thing as a standard printed circuit board each board is designed for its own use and must be the right size to fit the required space board designers use computer aided design software to layout the circuit designs on the board the spaces between electrical paths can be inches mm or smaller the location of the holes for component leads or contact points are also laid out once the circuit pattern is laid out a negative image is printed out at exact size on a clear plastic sheet with a negative image the areas that are not part of the circuit pattern are shown in black and the circuit pattern is shown as clear the metal is then removed from the clear areas usually with chemicals this design is made into instructions for a computer controlled drilling machine or for the automatic solder paste used in the manufacturing process the card is made with outer layers of copper unwanted copper is removed leaving copper wires that will connect the electronic components the components are placed on the board making contact with the wires circuit boards are sometimes made with photolithography a covering called photoresist reacts with light and then the circuit board and covering are put in a developer this method is expensive per board but very cheap to set up in the beginning there are however different methods of making a circuit board some professionally made circuit boards use a different method to remove extra copper from the circuit board a process called silk screen printing is used silk screening is when a cloth is pulled tight over a frame then an image is printed onto the cloth then ink is pressed through the cloth the ink does not go where the image has been printed on the cloth it is called silk screening because the cloth is usually silk the cloth is usually silk because it has very small holes silk screening is used to print an ink called resist onto the board resist is an ink that resists the etchant used to make the circuit board etchant dissolves the copper on the board this is cheaper for each board than photo resist but is more expensive in the beginning another way to make a circuit board is to use a mill a mill is a drill that moves in many directions the drill removes a small amount of copper each time it moves across the board the mill removes the copper around the wires on the board this leaves extra copper on the board other methods do not leave the extra copper on the board this method is cheaper per board but the equipment to make it is expensive this method is not used often because the other two methods are easier", " a public address system commonly known as a pa system is a network of sound devices that can play sound to several

siren is a device that is able to produce a loud noise sirens can be found on emergency vehicles like ambulances they are also installed on buildings to warn of tornadoes or air raids vehicles used by firefighters fire truck police officers police car and paramedics emergency medical technicians ambulance are often fitted a siren to warn people that the vehicle is coming and to make a clear path usually by pulling over these vehicles often may break some traffic laws when traveling to an emergency if other vehicles do not stop and make a path an accident could happen in world war ii many nations installed air raid sirens in cities to warn when enemy planes were coming to attack with bombs after the war ended these sirens were kept ready to sound in case a new war started due to the tense relationship between the united states and soviet union ussr now russia that existed from as weapons have gotten faster quieter and harder to spot the ability to provide warning before a bomb or missile falls has become difficult a number of countries including the united states now use their sirens to warn of severe weather such as tornadoes tsunamis emergencies at dams chemical plants and

used for electronics and electrical work hard solder melts at a higher temperature with a torch using solder is called soldering there are two main types of soft solder lead solder and lead free solder lead solders have about or tin and or lead in them they are toxic because they have lead in them they melt at around c lead solder is cheap so it used to be popular in plumbing a tin and lead mixture was used people thought this was safe but then they saw that the lead was coming into the water now lead solder is illegal for water lead solder was once used for food cans after many years the lead could come into the food the cans poisoned people who ate the food lead solder is still used in electronics in the european union china and california banned lead in consumer products lead solder became illegal in electronic devices in some places lead free solder was needed many lead free solders have tin silver and copper in them they melt around c sometimes indium is added to the solder to make it better but indium is very expensive many times when a metal is being soldered it oxidizes making a layer of metal oxide that does not hold solder flux is added to react with the metal oxide and turn it back into the metal again that helps the solder connect to the metal rosin is a common flux some electronics makers use fluxes that can be washed away with water some solders have a flux core where the flux is inside the solder another type of solder is used to connect glass to other things they melt around c a use of solder holding a wire to a circuit board lead free solder flux core solder macro shot of flux cored piece of solder", " soldering is a process in which two or more metal items are joined together they are heated with a soldering iron a filler metal called solder with a relatively low melting point melts and flows into the joint mixing with and melting a little of the items being soldered soft soldering is characterized by the melting point of the filler metal which is below c some metals such as iron are rarely soldered because their melting point is too high solder used in electronic equipment and for many other purposes has a flux to help clean the material that is soldered the helping hand tool can make soft soldering easier by holding wires still and close together and magnifying to see smaller wires or circuit boards the process can also be undone which is called desoldering this involves removing the solder so that the two items can be separated this can just be done by touching them with the soldering iron until the solder is liquid then pulling them apart but there are a few tools that help when trying to desolder something solder wick is made of very thin copper wires woven together into a long strip when the solder wick is placed between the soldering iron and the solder the wick absorbs the solder and the items can be taken apart a desoldering pump is a long tube that has a small hole on one side and a plunger on the other side that can be pushed down when the plunger is down the small hole is placed over the solder and then the solder is heated with the soldering iron a button on the side of the desoldering pump can be pushed to make the plunger come back up fast enough that it creates suction that sucks the heated solder off the items and into the pump ", " a soldering iron is a device used to attach pieces of metal together with solder which is called soldering soldering irons are used mainly for attaching electronic components onto a circuit board with tin but can also be used for other tasks such as fixing jewelry there are several different kinds of soldering irons such as ones that are hotter than others and ones that use electricity or natural gas a soldering iron stand can be used to hold the iron that is a flat metal stand with a coil that holds the iron", " solid state electronics are electronic circuits that contain only solid materials examples of solid state devices include transistors diodes and integrated circuits devices that are not solid state include vacuum tubes gas filled tubes and devices with moving parts such as relays", " a spin valve is a device which consist of two metallic magnetic layers separated by a non magnetic spacer whose electric resistance can change depending on the relative alignment of magnetization in the two magnetic layers electrons moving through a non magnetic material normally have random spins so the net effect is cancelled out when the magnetization of both the magnetic material are in the same direction or parallel the resistance in the sandwiched layer becomes low so that the electrons in the that layer have spins all aligned in one direction either all up or all down allowing a new way to store binary data in the form of one s all spins up and zeroes all spins down ", " spintronics is a kind of electronics that uses the tiny magnetic fields that come from electrons as well as their electric charge the word spintronics is made up of the words spin and electronics in atoms electrons can be said to go around the nucleus of an atom and possess some spinning energy they also have their own spin like a spinning top which is separate from the atom and they keep even when they are moving freely there are two ways for something to spin clockwise and anti clockwise in the tiny quantum world the terms up or down are used instead the electron spin of large numbers of electrons plays a role as a source of the magnetism in permanent magnets in most materials these spins are random in direction and so no magnetic field results in normal electronics the flow of current in a wire can also be used to produce a magnetic field which is known as electromagnetism neither of these form a part of spintonics in spintronics the property of the spin of the electrons themselves is used directly it makes use of the electrons in a solid metal or semiconductor in spintronics the electron spin of just a few electrons in a material are made to align in one direction by briefly applying a very large magnetic field even when the magnetic field is removed the electrons will remain aligned in their spins this alignment will slowly fade away over time but will persist for a while since these aligned spins produce a resultant magnet field they can be detected and even used to move the electrons the deliberate moving of only those electrons with a certain spin can be used to store information and this technology has been called spintronics to distinguish it from conventional use of electrons in electronics which uses their electric charge only spintonics is an area of research in which scientists are trying to make useful devices and are making progress some devices write the electron spin codes into the surface of a moving disk and others make them in sold transistor junctions as ram they promise a technology that could create faster and smaller electronic devices that use less energy ", " a stepper motor is an electric motor that is able to create sharp movements it is used for example in printers typically it has more than two wires that are needed to control it a stepper motor needs an electrical circuit to work there are several versions of stepper motors and several ways to drive those", " a superconductor is a substance that conducts electricity without resistance when it becomes colder than a critical temperature at this temperature electrons can move freely through the material superconductors are different from ordinary conductors even very good ones ordinary conductors lose their resistance slowly as they get colder in contrast superconductors lose their resistance all at once this is an example of a phase transition high magnetic fields destroy superconductivity and restore the normal conducting state normally a magnet moving by a conductor produces currents in the conductor by electromagnetic induction but a superconductor actually pushes out magnetic fields entirely by inducing surface currents instead of letting the magnetic field pass through the superconductor acts like a magnet pointing the opposite way which repels the real magnet this is called the meissner effect and it can be demonstrated by levitating a superconductor over magnets or vice versa physicists explain superconductivity by describing what happens when temperatures get cold the thermal energy in a solid or liquid shakes the atoms so they randomly vibrate but this gets less as the temperature drops electrons carry the same negative electric charge which makes them repel each other at higher temperatures each electron behaves as if it were a free particle there is also however a very weak attraction between electrons when they are in a solid or liquid at rather large distances many hundreds of nanometers apart and low temperatures near absolute zero the attractive effect and lack of thermal energy allows pairs of electrons to hang together this is called a cooper pair and it is a quasiparticle that is it acts as if it were a new kind of particle in its own right even though it is made up of two fundamental electrons many overlapping cooper pairs can exist in the same nanometer sized space since paired electrons constitute a boson the motions of all of the cooper pairs within a single superconductor synchronise and they function as if they are a single entity small disturbances such as scattering of electrons are forbidden in this state and it moves as one showing no resistance to its motion it is hence now a superconductor", " surface mount technology smt uses electronic devices that are made to be placed directly onto the surface of printed circuit boards pcbs examples of surface mount devices are resistors capacitors leds and integrated circuits surface mounted devices are generally smaller than those used in the older through hole technology which need longer leads and holes in the circuit board ", " a teletypewriter tty also called a teletype or teleprinter is a device that sends a typed message to another place a teletypewriter has a typewriter keyboard a local printer so the user can see what has been typed and a transmitter messages can be sent over wires or radio waves teletypes were used mostly in the early to mid th century they were developed to improve telegraphs some of which also used

used to give one of the clearest pictures of any flat screen display and it uses much less electricity than older screens tft displays are very fragile because they are made as thin and light as possible but this means they need far less space widescreen displays which have an aspect ratio of are becoming the most popular form of television and monitor displays standard format which have an aspect ratio of was the most popular for a long time the number of pixels in a display screen is called the resolution the word resolution means the solution of a problem better resolution on a display screen describes how detailed a picture can be displayed each pixel is another detail on the screen this is normally described as two numbers width x height han thpe older crt displays tft dislays are also known as flatscreen flat panel and liquid crystal display lcd but these types are not always tfts tft displays are made with a special chemical technology called chemical vapor deposition with this special technology very thin glass can be coated with electrically conductive metal and still be transparent chemical vapor deposition makes the thinnest computer and television display screens possible as a result of applying this solution a capacitor with a transistor is fixed to the pixels therefore it is possible to create the necessary contrast among the minuses poor viewing angle impaired color rendering increased power consumption this technology has not yet been discontinued just because it is in high demand among consumers due to its affordable cost most display screens have hundreds of thousands of pixels each pixel has to be set to the right colour most display screens are capable of million colours in each pixel to make a clear picture the screen might need to make millions of calculations any group of pixels that change to the same colour can be changed with one calculation making the calculations much smaller for example if the picture to display was just a white screen the screens processor would only calculate the colour once and use the same calculation for the whole screen changing one pixel at a time would take many more calculations if the same picture was shown many times on the screen the processor would calculate the picture once and then repeat it in whatever position and in different sizes if needed the processor can make very complicated calculations but in the end it does less work this is called rendering technology rendering technology in the most modern displays is like making a mosaic a display with a resolution of x pixels has four times the number of pixels in an x resolution without rendering technology the x display would do four times as much work as an x display so rendering technology is very useful to make a bigger display with some of the same parts used to make a smaller display the response time is the length of time it takes between the processor receiving a signal from the computer or the television station and displaying something on the screen today s displays have a very low response time very fast it is hard to see response times but they can affect a clear picture a low response time is best for clear pictures when playing games and watching movies on the screen for office work and internet browsing a fast response time is less important tft response time is measured as the average time it takes to change the pixels from one shade of grey to another shade of grey changing a pixel between colours takes more time than changing from black to white on a display screen tft is very fast for changing between colours which is more important for movies and games positive aspects of tft displays negative aspects of tft displays at one time there were some positive advantages of crt displays which are no longer true negative aspects of crt displays tn is an abbreviation for twisted nematic this is a new kind of tft technology they offer higher

electrical circuit to another through mutual electromagnetic induction and without change in frequency transformers are an important part of electrical systems transformers are made in many different sizes from a very small coupling transformer inside a stage microphone to big units that carry hundreds of mva used in power grids the main reason to use a transformer is to make power of one voltage level into power of another voltage level high voltage is easier to send a long distance but less voltage is easier and safer to use in the office or home transformers are used to increase or decrease alternating current ac voltage in circuits the transformer is usually built with two coils around the same core the primary coil or input coil is connected to supply side while secondary coil supplies power to load the second one is called the output coil energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary by electromagnetism in power grids many transformers are used these are networks for delivering electricity from the generator and to the user the transformers in your neighborhood on electricity poles or the ones connected to underground wires usually transform high voltage of volts to volts of electricity to power lights and appliances such as refrigerators in homes and businesses some countries such as america use different voltages in homes such as volts transformers cannot increase power so if the voltage is raised the current is proportionally lowered if the voltage is lowered the current is proportionally increased transformers inside electronics equipment provide the

simulators for power electronics hardware in the loop as an alternative to expensive and sometimes dangerous bench testing hardware in the loop systems were widely used in other fields at the time such as automotive development however at that time it was a novelty to offer equivalent solutions for power electronics applications the reason for the implementation problems is the high switching frequency of the converters involved switching frequencies of khz are common in order to accurately simulate power electronics converter behavior in this context simulation step sizes of less than a microsecond are required typical dsp processors cannot reach such short computational cycle times so the solution was found by developing a specialized hw solver running on an fpga comprehensive software package including a schematic editor and a specialized compiler was provided in order to make the system easy to use in typhoon hil has the following locations worldwide additionally there are service distribution partners for china india japan south korea spain mexico and various other countries the main focus of typhoon hil is still on real time hil simulators the offer is supplemented by a complete software solution typhoon hil control center for the development of high fidelity real time capable models execution of manual tests and test automation typhoon hil real

vhs cassettes can be recorded using a video camera they can also be recorded with a videocassette recorder or vcr a vcr can use a vhs cassette to record broadcast television this system was created in by the victor company of japan also called jvc vhs was a very popular way for people to record and play video at home in the s and s but now dvd digital versatile disc and blu ray have become more popular as they can be easier to use the quality is higher they last longer and the discs and players are cheaper to make vhs vcrs as well as blank tapes and pre recorded vhs movies are no longer made

video tape recorder to become popular and make money was the ampex vrx which was introduced in by ampex corporation it cost us in over in money and us over in money for a minute reel of tape because it was so expensive it was made and sold only for professional recording while kenjiro takayanagi a television broadcasting pioneer was the vice president of jvc he decided that his company could make money by developing and selling vtrs in japan and at a lower price in jvc developed a two head video tape recorder and by they had a color television version for professional broadcasting in jvc released the dv it would be the company s standard vtr until the mid s in jvc worked with sony corporation and matsushita electric who owned panasonic to design a video recording technical standard for japanese consumers they developed the u matic tape format in which was the first format to become a technical standard for vtrs the u matic format was successful in business and some video broadcasting however few people bought u matic vtrs to use at home because they were still very expensive and the tapes could only record short time periods of video soon after sony and matsushita stopped working on the project they started to work on their own video recording formats sony started working on betamax and matsushita started working on vx jvc released the cr in which was based on the u matic format sony and matsushita also produced their own u matic machines in jvc engineers named yuma shiraishi and shizuo takano started a team to develop a vtr for people to use at home by the end of they created an diagram titled vhs development matrix which listed goals for jvc s new vtr in video recording industry in japan started to lose money jvc had to find ways to spend less money so

record their favorite television shows to watch them later this was called time shifting in the mid s vcrs became a very popular way for people to watch movies and other recorded programs on their home television until the st century video rental stores offered a large selection of movies recorded on vhs tapes that customers could rent in the s some video rental stores also offered a smaller number of movies recorded on beta tapes in the s vhs was involved in a format war with sony s betamax vhs won the format war betacam a variant of betamax designed specifically for professional camcorders did become popular in television studios but consumers used vhs at home in the japanese government s ministry of international trade and industry miti tried to force the japanese video industry to agree on just one home video recording format in order to avoid consumer confusion later sony built a prototype of a betamax vtr sony presented the prototype to miti and convinced them to use betamax as the technical standard sony was then allowed to charge other companies licensing fees to use the betamax technical standard so that they could also build and sell betamax machines jvc believed that an open standard a technical standard that is open and free for anyone to use like vhs was better for the consumer so they fought against the miti and sony jvc attempted to convince other companies including matsushita to use vhs instead of betamax matsushita agreed with jvc because matsushita worried that sony might become the most powerful company in the video recording industry if the betamax format was the only one that the miti allowed them to sell matsushita also disliked the fact that betamax systems could only record one hour of video because matsushita agreed with jvc hitachi mitsubishi and sharp began to support the vhs technical standard when sony released its betamax machines in japan in it pressured the miti to support sony even more however the combination of jvc and the other companies was much stronger and eventually the miti stopped trying to create a single technical standard for the whole industry jvc released the first vhs machines in japan in late and then in the united states in early sony continued to sell betamax machines and they competed with vhs throughout the late s and into the s in countries that use the ntsc technical standard for television broadcasting the beta i version of betamax was able to record one hour of video at a tape speed of inches per second ips which was similar to a vhs standard play mode sp originally vhs recorded two hours of video at ips betamax s smaller sized cassettes were not able to contain as much magnetic tape as vhs cassettes they could not compete fit longer lengths of tape into the cassettes to match vhs s two hour recording time instead sony had to slow the tape speed down to ips beta ii in order to reach two hours of video recording in the same cassette size this meant that the television picture produced by a betamax tape was worse than vhs when comparing two hour recordings source sony eventually released a longer betamax cassette called beta iii which allowed ntsc betamax to record more than two hours but by then vhs had already won the format war vhs also used a less complicated set of mechanisms to read the magnetic tape than betamax and vhs machines were faster at rewinding winding the magnetic tape back to its starting place so that the video starts from the beginning the next time and fast forwarding than betamax machines in countries that use the pal and secam technical standards for their television broadcasting betamax s recording time was similar to vhs and the picture on the television was at least as good as vhs in the late s

enclosed area via a refrigeration cycle in which warm air is removed and replaced with cooler air in construction a complete system of heating ventilation and air conditioning is referred to as hvac whether in homes offices or vehicles its purpose is to provide comfort by altering the properties of the air usually by cooling the air inside the main function of air conditioner is to change adverse temperature in the th century british scientist and inventor michael faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate in american physician dr john gorrie used compressor technology to create ice which he used to cool air for his patients he hoped eventually to use his ice making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings and even considered cooling entire cities with a system of centralized air conditioning units air conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into comfort and process comfort applications aim to provide an indoor environment that remains relatively constant in a range preferred by humans despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads process applications aim to provide a suitable environment for an industrial or a commercial process regardless of internal heat loads and external weather conditions although often in the same comfort range it is the requirements of the process that determines conditions not human preference process applications include other examples include in both comfort and process applications the objective is not only to control temperature although in some comfort applications this is all that is controlled but also factors like humidity air movement and air quality in the refrigeration cycle a pump transfers heat from a lower temperature source into a higher temperature heat sink heat will naturally flow in the opposite direction this is the most common type of air conditioning a refrigerated air conditioning system works in much the same way pumping heat out of the room in which it stands this cycle takes advantage of the universal gas law pv nrt where p is pressure v is volume r is the universal gas constant t is temperature and n is the number of molecules of gas mole molecules the most common refrigeration cycle uses an electric motor to drive a compressor in an automobile the compressor is driven by a pulley on the engine s crankshaft with both using electric motors for air circulation since evaporation occurs when heat is absorbed and condensation occurs when heat is released air conditioners are designed to use a compressor to cause pressure changes between two compartments and actively pump a coolant around an enclosed system the cooling liquid or refrigerant is pumped into the cooled compartment the evaporator coil low pressure then causes the refrigerant to evaporate taking the heat with it in the other compartment the condenser the refrigerant vapour is compressed and forced through another heat exchange coil condensed into a liquid which then rejects the heat previously absorbed from the cooled space air conditioning has as much influence on human health as any generic heating system poorly maintained air conditioning systems especially large centralized systems can occasionally promote the growth and spread of microorganisms such as legionella pneumophila the infectious agent responsible for legionnaire s disease air conditioning can have a positive effect on sufferers of allergies and asthma in serious heat waves air conditioning can save the lives of the elderly some local authorities have even set up public cooling centers for the benefit of those without air conditioning at home one of the main conditions for the high quality installation of hvac equipment is the correct choice of the fixing location of the indoor and outdoor units each of the listed modules is distinguished by certain design characteristics rules for future installation to install an air conditioner you need to take into account all the requirements thanks to which the equipment can be further operated in different modes you need to install an air conditioner given the following nuances the installation of an air conditioner depends on certain criteria it starts with finding the ideal site for mounting the outdoor unit to do this there are several recommendations archived at the wayback machine", " analogue computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems some are used to control machines they were once the only way a machine could be controlled and are still used in cases where digital computers are not the best choice the abacus a digital device also sometimes called a computer was used by babylonians in c bc the earliest known analogue computer in metal was the antikythera device however this was certainly not the first in other forms some people think that mental inventions count as analogue computers such as the invention of the zero ancient egypt bc but in that case almost every invention by mankind would count as an analogue computer and that is not really how the term is used certainly the invention of the slide rule was important for calculations they were developed in the th century by william oughtred after john napier s work on logarithms slide rules are definitely mechanical calculating machines they were the most commonly used tools in science and engineering before the s s for the industrial revolution the invention of james watt s governor was critical because it was a negative feedback control for large pumps and engines in fact most analogue computers work with continuous data rather that discrete or digital data they are

causes the water level in the well to rise to a point where the pressure is equal to the weight of water putting it under pressure this type of well is called an artesian well water may even reach the ground surface if the natural pressure is high enough in which case the well is called a flowing artesian well an aquifer is a geologic layer which can hold water such as sand and gravel limestone or sandstone through which water flows and is stored an artesian aquifer is trapped between rocks or clay which causes the pressure water returns to the aquifers when the water table at its recharge zone is at a higher elevation than the head of the well fossil water aquifers can also be artesian if they are under sufficient pressure from the surrounding rocks this is similar to how many newly tapped oil wells are pressurized artesian wells were named after the old province of artois in france many artesian wells were drilled there by carthusian monks from there are artesian aquifers in many

many go on to start their own recording studios or maintain a private studio or mobile recording service a few work only for a single recording artist band or producer several colleges and universities in the united states and other countries offer classes in recording which may cover its history its uses and of course technique and technical knowledge some schools offer degree or diploma programs in recording graduating such a program does not guarantee a person a studio job but increases one s chances and can provide better preparation for such a career besides studio work

in the industrial revolution their engines were used for pumping water in canals mines and waterworks and for driving machines at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harper s hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually make more and more of the parts and by they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal there they built a new foundry for making the engines the soho foundry opened in at a time when watt s sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management

create diodes that make electricity go in one direction or to make transistors and semiconductor switches when the element boron is added to silicon the boron dopant is called an acceptor because it likes accepting electrons when the element phosphorous is added to silicon the phosphorous is called a donor because it does not like electrons there are two types of doping n type negative type doping p type positive type doping n type doping in this element with five valence electrons are added as impurity pentavalent impurity or donor impurity in the semiconductor semiconductor has four valence electrons when it is doped with pentavalent impurity the four valence electron makes covalent bond and the remaining one is now free to move this is how n type doping increases conductivity of the semiconductor due to excess of electron e in the n type semiconductor it generates an overall negative charge and thus the name n type semiconductor p type doping in this element with three valence electron are added as impurity trivalent impurity or acceptor impurity in the semiconductor the three electron in the semiconductor bonds with the three electrons of the dopant the one electron could not make bond and thus the vacant space where electron should be there is created this vacant space is know as holes electron from another atom jumps in these hole to fill it and a hole is created there and then the same thing continues thus by this way conductivity is increased in p type doping the impurities are added to the silicon through multiple processes including spin coating a thin layer of phosphorus or boron usually mixed with a liquid to help it spread out is spun at high speeds on the silicon the mixture spreads out the phosphorous or boron and then is baked another process involves a scaled down particle accelerator that smashes atoms of the chosen dopant into the silicon which adds the impurity called ion implantation ", " drainage is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub surface water from a given area many agricultural soils need drainage to improve production or to manage water supplies the earliest archaeological record of an advanced

this may result in an increase of financial capital environmental value national and personal security and human comfort individuals and organizations that consume energy may conserve energy to reduce costs and promote economic political and environmental sustainability industrial and commercial users may want to increase efficiency and thus maximize profit on a larger scale energy conservation is an energy policy in general energy conservation reduces the energy consumption and energy demand per capita this reduces the rise in energy costs and can reduce the need for new power plants and energy imports the reduced energy demand can provide more flexibility in choosing the methods of energy production by reducing emissions energy conservation helps to prevent climate change energy conservation makes it easier to replace non renewable resources with renewable energy energy conservation is often the most economical solution to energy shortages the u s is the largest consumer of energy although at current levels of growth china may become the leading energy consumer the u s department of energy categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors transportation residential commercial and industrial energy usage in the transportation and residential sectors about half of u s energy consumption is largely controlled by individual domestic consumers commercial and industrial energy usage are controlled by businesses national energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors the transportation sector includes all vehicles used for personal or freight transportation of the energy used in this sector about is used by gasoline powered vehicles mostly personally owned diesel powered transport trains merchant ships heavy trucks etc consumes about and air traffic consumes most of the remaining the oil supply crises of the s spurred the creation in of the federal corporate average fuel economy cafe program which required auto manufacturers to meet progressively higher fleet fuel economy targets the next decade saw dramatic improvements in fuel economy mostly the result of reductions in vehicle size and weight these gains eroded somewhat after due to the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles pickup trucks and minivans which fall under the more lenient light truck cafe standard in addition to the cafe program the u s government has tried to encourage better vehicle efficiency through tax policy since taxpayers have been eligible for income tax credits for gas electric hybrid vehicles a gas guzzler tax has been assessed on manufacturers since for cars with exceptionally poor fuel economy while this tax remains in effect it currently generates very little revenue as overall fuel economy has improved another focus in gasoline conservation is reducing the number of miles driven an estimated of american automobile use is associated with daily commuting many urban areas offer subsidized public transportation to reduce commuting traffic and encourage carpooling by providing designated high occupancy vehicle lanes and lower tolls for cars with multiple riders in recent years telecommuting has also become a viable alternative to commuting for some jobs a vehicle s gas mileage normally decreases rapidly at speeds above miles per hour a car or truck moving at miles an hour can get about percent better fuel economy than the same car going mph according to the u s department of energy doe as a rule of thumb each mph you drive over mph is similar to paying an additional per gallon for gas at per gallon the residential sector refers to all private residences including single family homes apartments manufactured homes and dormitories energy use in this sector varies significantly across the country due to regional climate differences and different regulation on average about half of the energy used in the u s homes is expended on space conditioning i e heating and cooling the efficiency of furnaces and air conditioners has increased steadily since the energy crises of the s the national appliance energy conservation act authorized the department of energy to set minimum efficiency standards for space conditioning equipment and other appliances each year based on what is technologically feasible and economically justified despite technological improvements many american lifestyle changes have put higher demands on heating and cooling resources the average size of homes built in the united states has increased significantly from ft in to ft in the single person household has become more

government restaurants schools and other workplaces energy in this sector has the same basic end uses as the residential sector in slightly different proportions space conditioning is again the single biggest consumption area but it represents only about of the energy use of commercial buildings lighting at plays a much larger role than it does in the residential sector lighting is also generally the most wasteful component of commercial use a number of case studies indicate that more efficient lighting and elimination of over illumination can reduce lighting energy by approximately fifty percent in many commercial buildings commercial buildings can greatly increase energy efficiency by thoughtful design with today s building stock being very poor examples of the potential of systematic not expensive energy efficient design steffy commercial buildings often have professional management allowing centralized control and coordination of energy conservation efforts solar heat loading through standard window designs usually leads to high demand for air conditioning in summer months an example of building design overcoming this excessive heat loading is the dakin building in brisbane california where fenestration was designed to achieve an angle with respect to sun incidence to allow maximum reflection of solar heat this design also assisted in reducing interior over illumination to enhance worker efficiency and comfort the industrial sector represents all production and processing of goods including manufacturing construction farming water management and mining increasing costs have forced energy intensive industries to make substantial efficiency improvements in the past years for example the energy used to produce steel and paper products has been cut in that time frame while petroleum aluminum refining and cement production have reduced their usage by about these reductions are largely the result of recycling waste material and the use of cogeneration equipment for electricity and heating the energy required for delivery and treatment of fresh water often constitutes a significant percentage of a region s electricity and natural gas usage an estimated of california s total energy use is water related in light of this some local governments have worked toward a more integrated approach to energy and water conservation efforts unlike the other sectors total energy use in the industrial sector has declined in the last decade while this is partly due to conservation efforts it s also a reflection of the growing trend for u s companies to move manufacturing operations offshore the usage of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy as many americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day", " engine knocking is the sound produced in an internal combustion engine when the fuel does not ignite properly the mixture of petrol and air is meant to be ignited only by the spark plug at the right moment in the stroke of the piston in the engine if there is a problem with the engine this fuel and air mixture can be

" failure rate is the frequency with which an engineered system or component fails usually it is expressed in a number of failures per time period like failures per hour it is often written as the greek letter lambda and is important in reliability theory in practice the closely related mean time between failures mtbf is more commonly expressed and used for high quality components or systems failure rate is usually time dependent and an intuitive corollary is that the rate changes over time versus the expected life cycle of a system for example as an automobile grows older the failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service one simply does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe overhaul the brakes or have major transmission problems in a new vehicle mean time between failures mtbf is closely related to failure rate in the special case when the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time for example in some product like a brick or protected steel beam and ignoring the time to recover from failure failure rate is simply the inverse of the mean time between failures mtbf mtbf is an important specification parameter in all aspects of high importance engineering design such as naval architecture aerospace engineering automotive design etc in short any task where failure in a key part or of the whole of a system needs be minimized and severely curtailed particularly where lives might be lost if such factors are not taken into account these factors account for many safety and maintenance practices in engineering and industry practices and government regulations such as how often certain inspections and overhauls are required on an aircraft a similar ratio used in the transport industries especially in railways and trucking is mean distance between failure a variation which attempts to correlate actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices failure rates are important factors in insurance business and regulation practices as well as fundamental to design of safe systems throughout a national or international economy", " feedback is a connection a loop between the cause and effect of a process sometimes output from an electronic source affects future input this can form what is called a feedback loop in some cases the output reinforces the input making it stronger this is called self reinforcing positive runaway or amplifying in other cases the output blocks or stops some of the input this is called a negative feedback loop think about a sound system with input from a microphone and output to a loudspeaker if the sound coming out of the loudspeaker is heard by the microphone a loop is created from speaker to the microphone through the cord and back into the speaker the loop is made up of sound and the electrical energy that the microphone and loudspeaker use to create that sound if nothing stops the sound and electricity in the loop it will travel faster and faster which is why feedback starts out as a low hum and turns into a high squeal very quickly this is an example of a positive feedback loop the output reinforces the input it makes the input stronger think about two mirrors that face each other the mirrors reflect each other infinitely or forever but in each reflection the image in the mirror is slightly smaller than the image it reflects the images get smaller and smaller until they are no longer visible this is an example of a negative feedback loop the output the reflection reduces the input it makes the input smaller warm temperature caused a glacier to melt as the glacier melts areas that were at one time covered by snow and ice are now water or land because snow and ice reflect heat but water and land absorb heat this causes the glacier to melt faster as more snow and ice is melted this type of positive feedback is an example of thermal runaway american mathematician norbert wiener made feedback loops more well known in in his book cybernetics cybernetics is the study of feedback loops and their role in communication and control", " the finite element method fem is a numerical method of solving systems of differential equations they are used extensively in many fields of engineering because they require very little knowledge of mathematics beyond basic algebra to use it belongs to the methods of weighted residuals in that the problem is formulated such that some conditions are satisfied exactly while others are satisfied only approximately or numerically i e the residual being the difference between the exact solution and the approximate solution is weighted and minimized to get the best approximation while the ease of setting up a problem using finite elements and getting a solution is the reason for its popularity it is also the cause of its frequent misuse and distrust of the answers obtained usually you have to check your results with an experiment before your model is acceptable for use it is the author s observation that the use of finite elements in structural analysis is in particular poorly managed engineers typically begin working with fem having very little knowledge of numerical methods or knowledge of finite element behavior there are no standards and guidelines for modeling and few managers who understand well enough to regulate modeling it has led to mistrust of the method its arrested development and some very bad analysis being performed that is copied by others much aircraft structural design is analyzed using fem ", " a fluid coupling or hydraulic coupling or fluid flywheel is a device used to transmit rotating mechanical power it has been used in automobile transmissions as an alternative to a mechanical clutch it is simpler than a torque converter but it does not provide any torque multiplication so it must be used together with a gearbox", " a flywheel is a heavy disk or wheel that is attached to a rotating shaft flywheels are used for storage of kinetic energy the momentum of the flywheel causes it to not change its rotational speed easily because of this flywheels help to keep the shaft rotating at the same speed this helps when the torque applied to the shaft changes often uneven torque can change the speed of rotation because the flywheel resists changes in speed it decreases the effects of uneven torque engines which use pistons to provide power usually have uneven torque and use flywheels to fix this problem it takes energy to get a wheel any wheel to rotate if there is little friction good bearings then it will keep rotating a long time when energy is needed it can be taken from the wheel again so it is a simple mechanical means of storing energy the amount of energy stored is a function of the weight and the speed of rotation making a heavier wheel rotate faster takes more energy another factor is the radius size because the farther from the axis a part of the wheel is the more energy it takes to make is rotate these three factor can be represented by m mass displaystyle omega angular velocity and r radius combining the two equations below gives displaystyle omega mr a fly wheel is not just any wheel but specifically designed to store energy so it should be heavy and or rotate fast for example some buses have a fly wheel that is used for stopping and starting when the bus stops e g for a traffic light the fly wheel is connected to the wheels so the rotational energy is transferred to it so the bus will slow down while the fly wheel speeds up then when the bus has to start driving again it is connected again and the energy is transferred back of course you wouldn t want to lug a heavy wheel around on a bus so it is made of a lighter material that can withstand extremely fast rotation the kinetic energy of a rotating flywheel is where the moment of inertia of center mass is equal to where i displaystyle i is the moment of inertia of the mass about the center of rotation and displaystyle omega omega is the angular velocity in radian units the flywheel has been used since ancient times the most common traditional example being the potter s wheel in the industrial revolution james watt contributed to the development of the flywheel in the steam engine and his contemporary james pickard used a flywheel in the world of venture capital the term flywheel is used to represent the recurrent margin generating heart of a business", " fracking or hydraulic fracturing is forcing fractures in a rock layer by fluid that is put under pressure although it can happen naturally it is now used as a method to force oil and natural gas from shale some hydraulic fractures form naturally certain dykes are examples this lets gas and petroleum from source rocks get to reservoir rocks the first use of hydraulic fracturing to extract substances from rock was in the modern fracturing technique called horizontal slickwater fracturing was first used in it made the extraction of shale gas economically practical the energy from the injection of a highly pressurized fluid creates new channels in the rock this increases the extraction rates and recovery of hydrocarbons which are used for fuel in it was estimated that of all new oil and gas wells worldwide were being hydraulically fractured as of the year million hydraulic fracturing actions have been done on oil and gas wells worldwide more than one million of them in the united states the supporters of hydraulic fracturing point to the economic benefits from the vast amounts of previously out of reach hydrocarbons opponents of fracking point to potentially harmful environmental effects these include contamination of ground water risks to air quality the migration of gases and hydraulic fracturing chemicals to the surface surface contamination from spills and flowback and the health effects of these for these reasons hydraulic fracturing has come under examination some countries are suspending or banning it in some of those countries including the united kingdom lifted their bans now they have regulations instead of outright prohibition fracking can greatly increase the uk gas reserves", " a gas compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume compression of a gas naturally increases its temperature when the gas is air the machine is called an air compressor compressors are similar to pumps both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe as gases are compressible the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas liquids are relatively incompressible so the main action of a pump is to transport liquids there are many different types of gas compressors the two primary categories are the more important types in each of the four sub categories are discussed below centrifugal compressors use a vaned rotating disk or impeller in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller increasing the velocity of the gas a diffuser divergent duct section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy they are primarily used for continuous stationary service in industries such as oil refineries chemical and petrochemical plants and natural gas processing plants their application can be from hp kw to thousands of horsepower with multiple staging they can achieve extremely high output pressures greater than psi mpa many large snow making operations like a ski resort use this type of compressor they are also used in internal combustion engines as superchargers and turbochargers centrifugal compressors are used in small gas turbine engines or as the final compression stage of medium sized gas turbines diagonal or mixed flow compressors are similar to centrifugal compressors but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor the diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to the axial direction the diagonal compressor has a lower diameter diffuser than the equivalent centrifugal compressor axial flow compressors use a series of fan like rotating rotor blades to progressively compress the gasflow stationary stator vanes located downstream of each rotor redirect the flow onto the next set of rotor blades the area of the gas passage diminishes through the compressor to maintain a roughly constant axial mach number axial flow compressors are normally used in high flow applications such as medium to large gas turbine engines they are almost always multi staged beyond about design pressure ratio variable geometry is often used to improve operation reciprocating compressors use pistons driven by a crankshaft they can be either stationary or portable can be single or multi staged and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines small reciprocating compressors from to horsepower hp are commonly seen in automotive applications and are typically for intermittent duty larger reciprocating compressors up to hp are still commonly found in large industrial applications but their numbers are declining as they are replaced by various other types of compressors discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure psi or mpa in certain applications such as air compression multi stage double acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available and are typically larger noisier and more costly than comparable rotary units rotary screw compressors use two meshed rotating positive displacement helical screws to force the gas into a smaller space these are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable their application can be from hp kw to over hp kw and from low pressure to very high pressure psi or mpa they are commonly seen with roadside repair crews powering air tools this type is also used for many automobile engine superchargers because it is easily matched to the induction capacity of a piston engine a scroll compressor also known as scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump uses two interleaved spiral like vanes to pump or compress fluids such as liquids and gases the vane geometry may be involute archimedean spiral or hybrid curves they operate more smoothly quietly and reliably than other types of compressors often one of the scrolls is fixed while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls a diaphragm compressor also known as a membrane compressor is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor the compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane instead of an intake element the back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism only the membrane and the compressor box come in touch with the gas being compressed diaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas cng as well as in a number of other applications air compressors sold to and used by the general public are often attached on top of a tank for holding the pressurized air oil lubricated and oil free compressors are available oil free compressors are desirable because without a properly designed separator oil can make its way into the air stream for some purposes for example as a diving air compressor even a little oil in the air stream may be unacceptable charles s law says when a gas is compressed temperature is raised there are three possible relationships between temperature and pressure in a volume of gas undergoing compression since compression generates heat the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal the inter stage coolers cause condensation meaning water separators with drain valves are present the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan for instance in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages if each stage has a compression ratio of to the compressor can output times atmospheric pressure x x atmospheres gas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed", " gears are mechanical parts with cut teeth designed to fit with teeth on another part so as to transmit

cold place to a hot place a refrigerator is a heat pump it moves heat from the inside to the outside this keeps the food inside cold so it will not spoil an air conditioner is a heat pump it moves heat from the inside of a building to the outside a peltier device is a heat pump it moves heat from one side to the other by means of an electric current some buildings are heated with heat pumps also in the winter the heat pump moves heat from the outside to the inside sometimes this works better than heating with a radiator usually heat flows from a hot place to a cold place according to the second law of thermodynamics heat will not move from a cold place to a warmer place by itself because of this a heat pump must use extra energy to move the heat this is sort of like pumping water uphill most heat pumps use electric motors to provide energy some heat pumps use heat energy supplied by a flame or an electric heater most heat pumps use a refrigeration cycle a refrigeration cycle uses a fluid which moves through tubes and carries the heat the fluid is called a refrigerant during the refrigeration cycle the refrigerant changes from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid when the refrigerant changes from a liquid to a gas it gains absorbs heat energy this is just like boiling when the refrigerant changes from a gas back to a liquid it loses heat energy the heat pump is set up so that the refrigerant gains heat from one place that will be cooled and moves it to another place that will be warmed a heat pump forces the refrigerant to change from a gas to a liquid it uses a compressor to do this often an electric motor drives the compressor the compressor compresses the refrigerant and this makes it change from a gas to a liquid when the refrigerant changes from a gas to a liquid it also gives up some of the heat that it has been carrying at the other end of the cycle the refrigerant boils again it changes from a liquid to a gas but it needs heat to do this when it takes up heat from its surroundings it cools them down so where the refrigerant is changing from a liquid to a gas it feels cooler this is the complete cycle from the cooling side to the heating side on the cooling side heat is taken up to boil the refrigerant from a liquid to a gas then the fluid moves to the heating side there the compressor forces the refrigerant back to a liquid again this makes it give up its heat so heat has moved from the cooling side to the heating side then the cycle repeats if the cooling side is the inside of a refrigerator it gets cold if the cooling side is the inside of a building and the warming side is the outside of the building the inside of the building gets cold this is how an air conditioner works if the cooling side is the outside of the building and the warming side is the inside of the building this is how a heat pump can heat a building during the winter", " a hollow structural section hss is a type of metal profile with a hollow tubular

article hydroelectricity hydroelectric power is a means of making electricity without burning fuel hydroelectric power supplies about mwe or of world electricity in large dams are still being designed apart from a few countries with plenty of it hydro power is normally applied to peak load demand because it is readily stopped and started nevertheless hydroelectric power is probably not a major

considerations hydropower produces essentially no carbon dioxide or other harmful emissions in contrast to burning fossil fuels and is not a significant contributor to global warming through co hydroelectric power can be far less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuel or nuclear energy areas with abundant hydroelectric power attract industry environmental concerns about the effects of reservoirs may prohibit development of economic hydropower sources harnessing the tides in a bay or estuary has been achieved in france since canada and russia and could be achieved in other areas with a large tidal range the trapped water turns turbines as it is released through the tidal barrage in either direction another possible fault is that the system would generate electricity most efficiently in bursts every six hours once every tide this limits how tidal energy can be used a relatively new technology tidal stream generators draw energy from currents in much the same way that wind generators do the higher density of water means that a single generator can provide significant power this technology is at the early stages of development and will need more

unmanned travel between stars interstellar travel is much more difficult than travel within the solar system though travel in starships is a staple of science fiction actually there is no suitable technology at present however the idea of a probe with an ion engine has been studied the energy would come through a laser base station given sufficient travel time and engineering work both unmanned and sleeper ship interstellar travel seem possible both present considerable technological and economic challenges which are unlikely to be met in the near future particularly for manned probes nasa esa and other space agencies have done research into these topics for several years and have worked out some theoretical approaches energy requirements appear to make interstellar travel impractical for generation ships but less so for heavily shielded sleeper ships the main challenge facing interstellar travel is the vast distances that have to be covered this means that a very great speed and or a very long travel time is needed the travel time with most realistic propulsion methods would be from decades to millennia hence an interstellar ship would be much more exposed to the hazards found in interplanetary travel including vacuum radiation weightlessness and micrometeoroids at high speeds the vehicle would be penetrated by many microscopic particles of matter unless heavily shielded carrying the shield would greatly increase the propulsion problems cosmic rays are of great interest because there is no protection outside the atmosphere and magnetic field the energies of the most energetic ultra high energy cosmic rays uhecrs have been observed to approach ev about million times the energy of particles accelerated by the large hadron collider at j the highest energy ultra high energy cosmic rays have energies comparable to the kinetic energy of a kilometre per hour mph baseball as a result of these discoveries there has been interest in investigating cosmic rays of even greater energies most cosmic rays however do not have such extreme energies the energy distribution of cosmic rays peaks at gigaelectronvolts j a significant factor is the energy needed for a reasonable travel time a lower bound for the required energy is the kinetic energy k mv where m is the final mass if deceleration on arrival is desired and cannot be achieved by any means other than the engines of the ship then the required energy at least doubles because the energy needed to halt the ship equals the energy needed to accelerate it to travel speed the velocity for a manned round trip of a few decades to even the nearest star is thousands of times greater than those of present space vehicles this means that due to the v term in the kinetic energy formula millions of times as much energy is required accelerating one ton to one tenth of the speed of light requires at least pj or j or billion kwh not accounting for losses the source of energy has to be carried since solar panels do not work far from the sun and other stars the magnitude of this energy may make interstellar travel impossible one engineer stated at least times the total energy output of the entire world in a given year would be required for the voyage to alpha centauri interstellar dust and gas may cause considerable damage to the craft due to the high relative speeds and large kinetic energies involved larger objects such as bigger dust grains are far less common but would be much more destructive the long travel times make it difficult to design manned missions the fundamental limits of space time present another challenge also interstellar trips would be hard to justify for economic reasons it can be argued that an interstellar mission which cannot be completed within years should not be started at all instead the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system this is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion on the other hand a case can therefore be made for starting a mission without delay because the non propulsion problems may turn out to be more difficult than the propulsion engineering intergalactic travel involves distances about a million fold greater than interstellar distances making it radically more difficult than even interstellar travel andrew kennedy has shown that voyages undertaken before the minimum wait time will be overtaken by those who leave at the minimum while those who leave after the minimum will never overtake those who left at the minimum kennedy s calculation depends on r the mean annual increase in world power production from any point in time to a given destination there is a minimum to the total time to destination voyagers would probably arrive without being overtaken by later voyagers by waiting a time t before leaving the relation between the time it takes to get to a destination now tnow or after waiting tt and growth in velocity of travel is taking a journey to barnard s star six light years away as an example kennedy shows that with a world mean annual economic growth rate of and a corresponding growth in the velocity of travel the quickest human civilization might get to the star is in years from the year astronomical distances are often measured in the time it would take a beam of light to travel between two points see light year light in a vacuum travels approximately kilometers per second or miles per second the distance from earth to the moon is light seconds with current spacecraft propulsion technologies a craft can cover the distance from the earth to the moon in around eight hours new horizons that means light travels approximately thirty thousand times faster than current spacecraft propulsion technologies the distance from earth to other planets in the solar system ranges from three light minutes to about four light hours depending on the planet and its alignment to earth for a typical unmanned spacecraft these trips will take from a few months to a little over a decade the distance to other stars is much greater if the distance from earth to sun is scaled down to one meter the distance to alpha centauri a would be kilometers or about miles the nearest known star to the sun is proxima centauri which is light years away the fastest outward bound spacecraft yet sent voyager has covered th of a light year in years and is currently moving at th the speed of light at this rate a journey to proxima centauri would take years of course this mission was not specifically intended to travel fast to the stars and current technology could do much better the travel time could be reduced to a few millennia using solar sails or to a century or less using nuclear pulse propulsion special relativity offers the possibility of shortening the travel time if a starship with sufficiently advanced engines could reach velocities near the speed of light relativistic time dilation would make the voyage much shorter for the traveller however it would still take many years of elapsed time as viewed by the people remaining on earth on returning to earth the travellers would find that far more time had elapsed on earth than had for them twin paradox many problems would be solved if wormholes existed general relativity does not rule them out but so far as we know at present they do not exist the round trip delay time is the minimum time between a probe signal reaching earth and the probe getting instructions from earth given that information can travel no faster than the speed of light this is for the voyager about hours near proxima centauri it would be years faster reactions would have to be programmed to be carried out automatically of course in the case of a manned flight the crew can respond immediately to their observations however the round trip delay time makes them not only extremely distant but in terms of communication extremely isolated from earth another factor is the energy needed for interstellar communications to arrive reliably obviously gas and particles would degrade signals interstellar extinction and there would be limits to the energy available to send the signal the mass of any craft capable of carrying humans would inevitably be substantially larger than that necessary for an unmanned interstellar probe the vastly greater travel times involved would require a life support system the first interstellar missions are unlikely to carry life forms there are known stellar systems within light years from the sun containing visible stars the following could be considered prime targets for interstellar missions radiation dangers would rule out any organic beings for an expedition to sirius in any event it is hard to visualise any manned expeditions at all given the probable journey times perhaps the most likely time for interstellar travel would be when a star comes through our oort cloud we should get a good

calculation it is a two dimensional diagram which gives a computation of a mathematical function the field of nomography was invented in by the french engineer philbert maurice d ocagne it was used for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d ocagne rather than standard cartesian coordinates a nomogram consists of a set of n scales one for each variable in an equation knowing the values of n variables the value of the unknown variable can be found or by fixing the values of some variables the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied the result is got by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable the virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an index line or isopleth nomograms were widely used for about years they allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators results from a nomogram are got quickly and reliably by drawing one or more lines the user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations look up data in tables use a slide rule or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results the user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents nomograms have domain knowledge into their design for example to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions all of these provide useful guideposts to the user like a slide rule a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device like the

knee and hip in ecology resilience has been defined in two competing fashions that emphasize two different aspects of stability one definition is the rate at which a system returns to a single steady or cyclic state following a perturbation this definition of resilience assumes that behavior of a system remains within the stable domain that contains this steady state when a system can reorganize that is shift from one stability domain to another a more relevant measure of ecosystem dynamics is ecological resilience it is a measure of the amount of change or disruption that is required to transform a system from being maintained by one set of mutually reinforcing processes and structures to a different set of processes and structures the second definition emphasizes conditions far from any steady states where instabilities can flip a system into another regime of behavior i e to another stability domain in this case resilience is measured by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system changes its structure by changing the variables and processes that control behavior this type of resilience has been defined as ecological resilience economic resilence is the ability of a local economy to retain function employment and prosperity in the face of the perturbation caused by the shock of the loss of a particular type of local industry or employer within the broad domain of industrial safety the term resilience has come into use to emphasise that safety must be proactive as well as reactive whereas conventional risk management approaches emphasise

them move steam engines can power many kinds of machines including vehicles and electric generators steam engines were used in mine pumps starting in the early th century and were much improved by james watt in the s they were very important during the industrial revolution where they replaced horses windmills and watermills to work machines the first steam engines were piston engines the steam pressure pushed on a piston which made it move along a cylinder and so they had a reciprocal back and forth motion this could move a pump directly or work a crank to turn a wheel and work a machine they operated at low pressure and had to be very big to make a lot of power steam engines were used in factories to work machines and in mines to move pumps later smaller engines were built that could move railway locomotives and steam boats the steam to power a steam engine is made in a boiler that heats water to make steam in most places fire heats the boiler fuel for the fire may be wood coal or petroleum nuclear energy or solar energy may be used instead of fire the steam coming out of the boiler applies the force on a piston a valve sends the steam to one end of the piston then the other to make it move backwards and forwards the moving piston pushes and pulls the piston rod crosshead and connecting rod to turn wheels or drive other machinery the heavy spinning flywheel smooths out the power from the piston the governor controls the speed of the engine today many steam engines are still at work during the th century the pistons were replaced by turbines which spin like a windmill

the force per unit area on a body that tends to cause it to change shape stress is a measure of the internal forces in a body between its particles these internal forces are a reaction to the external forces applied on the body that cause it to separate compress or slide external forces are either surface forces or body forces stress is the average force per unit area that a particle of a body exerts on an adjacent particle across an imaginary surface that separates them the formula for uniaxial normal stress is where is the stress f is the force and a is the surface area in si units force is measured in newtons and area in square metres this means stress is newtons per square meter or n m however stress has its own si unit called the pascal pascal symbol pa is equal to n m in imperial units stress is measured in pound force per square inch which is often shortened to psi the dimension of stress is the same as that of pressure in continuum mechanics the loaded deformable body behaves as a continuum so these internal forces are distributed continually within the volume of the material body this means that the stress distribution in the body is expressed as a piecewise continuous function of space and time the forces cause deformation of the body s shape the deformation can lead to a permanent shape change or structural failure if the material is not strong enough some models of continuum mechanics treat force as something that can change other models look at the deformation of matter and solid bodies because the characteristics of matter and solids are three dimensional each approach can give different results classical models of continuum mechanics assume an average force and do not properly include geometrical factors the geometry of the body can be important to how stress is shared out and how energy builds up during the application of the external force in some situations the stress within an object can be described by a single number or by a single vector a number and a direction three such simple stress situations are the uniaxial normal stress the simple shear stress and the isotropic normal stress tensile stress or tension is the stress state leading to expansion that is the length of a material tends to increase in the tensile direction the volume of the material stays constant when equal and opposite forces are applied on a body then the stress due to this force is called tensile stress therefore in a uniaxial material the length increases in the tensile stress direction and the other two directions will decrease in size in the uniaxial manner of tension tensile stress is induced by pulling forces tensile stress is the opposite of compressive stress structural members in direct tension are ropes soil anchors and nails bolts etc beams subjected to bending moments may include tensile stress as well as compressive stress and or shear stress tensile stress may be increased until the reach of tensile strength namely the limit state of stress all real objects occupy three dimensional space however if two dimensions are very large or very small compared to the others the object may be modelled as one dimensional this

tendency of a force to turn or twist if a force is used to begin to spin an object or to stop an object from spinning a torque is made the force applied to a lever multiplied by the distance from the lever s fulcrum multiplied again by the sine of the angle created is described as torque this is also known as r cross f or force times fulcrum distance times sine theta fulcrum is the axis of rotation or point of support on which a lever turns in raising or moving something the equation for torque is where f is the net force vector and r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is acting the greek letter tau is used to represent torque the units of torque are force multiplied by distance the si unit of torque is the newton metre the most common english unit is the foot pound ", " a torque converter or torque multiplier is a device for multiplying torque it is widely used in transmission systems for road and rail vehicles with internal combustion engines the diagram shows a hydraulic torque converter it contains two turbines and a stator the driven turbine can deliver high torque at low speed as the vehicle accelerates the speed goes up and the torque goes down this happens automatically so there is no need for the driver to change gear", " in mechanics a transmission or gearbox means gears working together the most common transmission is the transmission in a car in a car the engine makes the crankshaft spin the crankshaft makes the transmission s gears spin which spin some more parts which make the wheels spin but the wheels do not spin as fast as the engine makes the crankshaft spin that is because the gears are made to slow down the spinning the gears also give the spinning more force or to be more scientifically exact more torque so the wheels can make the entire car move most transmissions have a breather vent to let hot air escape a transmission has some gears that change the torque more than other gears that is why a transmission has a first gear second gear third gear and sometimes more gears there is also a reverse gear and neutral an automatic transmission shifts between gears by itself except reverse gear and a parking gear a manual transmission needs the driver to decide when to shift gears manual transmission is also called standard transmission this is confusing because almost all cars in the u s have automatic transmission in other words since the late th century standard transmission has been unusual a manual transmission usually has a clutch pedal which the driver must press while shifting gears an automatic transmission has a fluid coupling called a torque converter instead of a clutch some cars have a clutchless manual semi automatic transmission which has an automatic clutch no clutch pedal but does not shift gears by itself a layshaft is the middle shaft within a gearbox transmission when the clutch is engaged the layshaft turns constantly all gears on the layshaft turn at the same rate and are permanently attached it carries gears but does not transfer the primary drive of the gearbox in of the gearbox or out of the gearbox layshafts are mostly known through their use in car gearboxes the oil level in a gearbox is set to layshaft height that way the spinning gears distribute oil to all the gears not all transmissions are in cars for example bicycles have transmissions you can see the gears so it is easier to see how it works", " a turbine is an engine that turns fluid movement into energy simple turbines have a shaft with a blade on it moving fluids such as water or air push the blades so that they turn around with the shaft the turning movement is most often used to turn a generator early turbine examples are windmills and water wheels turbine blades can also be turned to move a fluid this is how simple propeller airplanes work a casing can be placed around the turbine to control the movement of the fluid", " two wheel drive wd describes vehicles in which in theory two wheels receive power from the engine at the same time usually the two wheels are on the same axle in the drivetrain most vehicles with two wheel drive are mainly for use on roads and highways two wheel drive cars and trucks are either front fwd or rear wheel drive rwd this means either the front or the rear axle is the drive axle that moves the vehicle forward when the vehicle begins to accelerate some of the weight of the vehicle is shifted to the rear giving a rear wheel drive car or better balance and traction two wheel drive systems are simple and rugged this is why rear wheel drive is so popular in police cars and other service vehicles traditional two wheel drive systems have a differential in the rear axle this is used for turning the vehicle if both drive wheels rotated at exactly the same rate the vehicle would have difficulty going around a corner in a turn the outside wheel has to go faster to keep up with the inside wheel which turns slower a differential allows one wheel to turn faster under these conditions this means only one of the two wheels actually has power at any given time a differential also prevents excessive tire wear of the two drive types rwd has more disadvantages in wet or slippery conditions having effectively only one drive wheel the tires are going to slip and lose traction a fwd not to be confused with wd vehicle will have better traction but in snow and icy conditions will not equal a four wheel drive car or truck ", " a water supply system or water supply network is an engineering system which provides a supply of water a water supply system typically includes the second part of the system is dealing with the sewage and waste water which is eventually put back or comes back into the system if this waste water is not purified cholera and typhoid epidemics will occur and still do occur in cities where the water engineering has not kept pace with population increase this type of system was a consequence of the work of john snow on the mid th century cholera plagues in london despite all efforts epidemics do still occur if there are leaks in the underground sewage system and leaks in the underground water pipes", " a water wheel is a hydropower system a machine for extracting power from the flow of water water wheels and hydropower was widely used in the middle ages powering most industry in europe along with the windmill the most common use of the water wheel was to mill flour in gristmills but other uses included foundry work and machining and pounding linen for use in paper a water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface most commonly the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle but the tub or norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load a channel created for the water to follow after leaving the wheel is commonly referred to as a tailrace main article watermill the technology of the water wheel had long been known but it was not put into widespread use until the middle ages when an acute shortage of labor made machines such as the water wheel cost effective however the water wheels in ancient rome and ancient china found many practical uses in powering mills for pounding grain and other substances the romans used both fixed and floating water wheels and introduced water power to other countries of the roman empire the romans were known to use waterwheels extensively in mining projects with enormous roman era waterwheels found in places like modern day spain in the st century bc the greek epigrammatist antipater of thessalonica was the first to make a reference to the waterwheel by at least the st century ad the chinese of the eastern han dynasty began to use waterwheels to crush grain in mills and to power the piston bellows in forging iron ore into cast iron in the text known as the xin lun written by huan tan about ad during the usurpation of wang mang it states that the legendary mythological king known as fu xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar which evolved into the tilt hammer and then trip hammer device see trip hammer although the author speaks of the mythological fu xi a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel was in widespread use by the st century ad in china in the year ad the engineer and prefect of nanyang du shi applied a complex use of the waterwheel and machinery to power the bellows of the blast furnace to create cast iron waterwheels in china found practical uses such as this as well as extraordinary use the inventor zhang heng was the first in history to apply motive power in rotating the astronomical instrument of an armillary sphere by use of a waterwheel the mechanical engineer ma jun once used a waterwheel to power and operate a large mechanical puppet theater for emperor ming of wei cistercian monasteries in particular made extensive use of water wheels to power mills of many kinds an early example of a very large waterwheel is still extant at the early th century real monasterio de nuestra senora de rueda a cistercian monastery in the aragon region of spain grist mills for corn were undoubtedly the most common but there were also sawmills fulling mills and mills to fulfill many other labor intensive tasks the water wheel remained competitive with the steam engine well into the industrial revolution the main difficulty of water wheels was their inseparability from water this meant that mills often needed to be located far from population centers and away from natural resources water mills were still in commercial use well into the twentieth century however overshot pitchback waterwheels are suitable where there is a small stream with a height difference of more than meters often in association with a small reservoir breastshot and undershot wheels can be used on rivers or high volume flows with large reservoirs breastshot waterwheel under shot waterwheel overshot waterwheel the most powerful waterwheel built in the united kingdom was the hp quarry bank mill waterwheel near manchester a high breastshot design it was retired in and replaced with several turbines it has now been restored and is a museum open to the public modern hydro electric dams can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill to turn a wheel", " a watermill is an engine that uses a water wheel or turbine to drive a mechanical process such as flour or lumber production or metal shaping rolling grinding or wire drawing a watermill that only generates electricity is more usually called a hydroelectric plant in ad a chinese engineer named du shi wade giles tu shih invented the first water powered bellows this was a complicated machine with gears axles and levers that was powered by a waterwheel this invention aided the forging of cast iron smelted from the blast furnace more extensive descriptions appear in literature of the th century the ancient greeks and romans used the technology in the st century bc the greek epigrammatist antipater of thessalonica was the first to make a reference to the waterwheel he praised it for its use in grinding grain and the reduction of human labor the romans used both fixed and floating water wheels and introduced water power to other countries of the roman empire so called greek mills used water wheels with a vertically mounted shaft a roman mill features a horizontally mounted shaft greek style mills are the older and simpler of the two designs but only operate well with high water velocities and with small diameter millstones roman style mills are more complicated as they require gears transmit the power from a shaft with a horizontal axis to one with a vertical axis an example of a roman era watermill would be the early th century site at barbegal in southern france where overshot waterwheels were used to power an enormous flour mill the cistercian order built huge mill complexes all over western europe during the medieval period in a survey the scholar adam lucas identified the following first appearances of various industrial mill types in western europe noticeable is the preeminent role of france in the introduction of new innovative uses of waterpower typically water is diverted from a river or impoundment or mill pond to a turbine or water wheel along a channel or pipe variously known as a flume head race mill race leat leet lade scots or penstock the force of the water s movement drives the blades of a wheel or turbine which in turn rotates an axle that drives the mill s other machinery water leaving the wheel or turbine is drained through a tail race but this channel may also be the head race of yet another wheel turbine or mill the passage of water is controlled by sluice gates that allow maintenance and some measure of flood control large mill complexes may have dozens of sluices controlling complicated interconnected races that feed multiple buildings and industrial processes watermills can be divided into two kinds one with a horizontal waterwheel on a vertical axle and the other with a vertical wheel on a horizontal axle the oldest of these were horizontal mills in which the force of the water striking a simple paddle wheel set horizontally in line with the flow turned a runner stone balanced on the rynd which is atop a shaft leading directly up from the wheel the bedstone does not turn the problem with this type of mill arose from the lack of gearing the speed of the water directly set the maximum speed of the runner stone which in turn set the rate of milling", " wind engineering studies effects of wind on the buildings and its possible damage or

they lived this was particularly a problem in the area to the left of the rhine which had been ruled by napoleon because in the th century when a farmer and his wife had died their land was shared between all their children so it got divided into smaller pieces in other parts of germany only the eldest son inherited the land since the s people understood that it would be much easier for a farmer to have all his fields together so that he did not have to keep making journeys between lots of small fields larger fields are easier to manage and more economical the german government encouraged farmers to swap some of their fields among themselves so that each farmer had his land all in one place in the last few years the government have realized that the way the changes have been made are not always good nature often suffers when hedgerows are taken away to make fields bigger flurbereinigung today tries to keep some of the hedgerows and small groups of trees which sometimes stand in the middle of fields they are good places for birds to nest and other animals like to live there too winegrowers do not always find it a good thing to have all their land together this is because the soil in one field may be slightly different from the soil in a field just farther up the road and this gives the wine a slightly different taste also if all their land is on one hillside

is not infected in cases where the animal cannot be found prophylactic rabies treatment is carried out in most places many of the world s snakes are not considered dangerous to humans but even a bite from a safe snake may injure the victim if the wound is not treated properly and large snakes such as constrictors are capable of causing a lot of damage with their bites the black widow spider and

certain tribes or countries or a medical practice reasons for performing a circumcision people disagree about whether circumcision is a good for health and sexual pleasure people who think circumcision is a good idea may point to health reasons circumcision reduces sexually transmitted diseases like hiv and hpv prevents certain kinds of cancer and gets rid of infections and unpleasant

bullying was a bigger problem in the past when boys had to take showers together at school after gym class or before swimming people opposed to routine circumcision are called intactivists the university of the western cape in south africa lists these benefits of medical male circumcision mmc some myths about medical male circumcision one study conducted in determined that the foreskin does not provide a sexual response or serve a sexual function in men instead it is the corona and frenular the area under the frenulum areas which provide sexual response due to the high concentration of genital corpuscles out of a large sample of kenyan men in a controlled trial of men reported higher penile sensitivity two years after circumcision while only reported lower penile sensitivity two years after circumcision it was deduced that even a retracted foreskin would tend to reduce the stimulus to the corona and frenular areas particularly on the outward stroke of intercourse the study determined that any sexual effect of circumcision must depend solely on the exposure of the glans and not on the absence of the prepuce the study concluded that male circumcision has no adverse effect on parameters relevant to sexual function sensation sensitivity satisfaction or pleasure the area of the outer and inner foreskin combined spans a wide range cm and cm respectively in discussing vestigial structures charles darwin stated an organ when rendered useless may well be variable for its variations cannot be checked by natural selection the variability in foreskin size is consistent with the foreskin being a vestigial structure those who believe that the foreskin is important for sexual pleasure are against circumcision others do not like circumcision because they believe it has no medical advantage or that it is easy to clean under the foreskin or that circumcision harms the penis or the mind people who do not like circumcision of baby boys say doctors and parents should not make this decision they say that the owner should choose when he is old enough to decide for himself however it will hurt more if done at a later age there are large groups of circumcised men according to the cdc the latest data from nchs on male circumcision in the united states show a overall increase in prevalence in males aged to years between and in contrast there has been a decline of in newborn circumcisions the newborn circumcision rate in the us dropped slightly from in the s to in the main reason for this point drop is most likely the much faster increase in the hispanic population the ethnic group having the lowest circumcision prevalence the growing hispanic population in the west accounts for most of the decrease in national prevalence because hispanic and black individuals are over represented in poorer demographics the withdrawal of medicaid funding for elective circumcision in states is of concern to public health as was also expressed by the authors of the cdc s recent report after controlling for other factors states with medicaid coverage had hospital circumcision rates percentage points higher than states without such coverage many but not all private health insurance plans pay for circumcision a study of male babies in the state of maryland found that of new baby boys were circumcised before they left the hospital more were circumcised in a religious ceremony or in a doctor s office later with those boys included of baby boys in maryland got circumcised it was less common for asian and hispanic babies than for non asian and non hispanic babies in islam and judaism male circumcision is commonly done for religious reasons in judaism religious law orders that baby boys be circumcised on the th day after their birth this is required even if the th day after birth is shabbat saturday in the jewish faith circumcision is an important tradition because it represents the newly born baby being included in the covenant or agreement which god made with the prophet abraham a mohel is someone who circumcises jewish baby boys eight days after they are born in accordance with jewish law a knife is traditionally used for this but a clamp is now sometimes used instead mohels are traditionally male but most types of non orthodox not fully traditional types of judaism allow women to be mohels without restriction for jews who observe religious law the circumcision is performed at a ceremony called a brit milah family relatives and guests attend others such as reform jews may choose to have the circumcision done in a hospital before the baby goes home they may have a celebration afterwards or after the birth of a baby girl for whom there is no ritual act in the quran no sura or ayat mention male or female circumcision however there are some injunctions of the prophet muhammad that explain and command only male circumcision as a continuation of abrahamic hebraic tradition for example the prophet muhammad said in a hadith that five are the acts which are part of fitrah a circumcision clipping or shaving the pubic hair cutting the nails plucking or shaving the hair under the armpits and clipping or shaving the moustache b also according to the qur an allah ordered muhammad to follow the religion of ibrahim the hebrew abraham then we inspired you follow the religion of ibrahim the upright in faith qur an many islamic scholars say that is an important ritual and a symbolic step of purification along the lines of abrahamic tradition most shafi islamic jurists judges say that circumcision is required for men it is an accepted tradition in almost all islamic sects and among most islamic scholars and theologians circumcision is also important within islam because islam claims to be the truth and the continuation of the old and true message of ibrahim abraham according to islam god s covenant with abraham was passed on to muhammad whose mission was to continue the covenant the covenant is continued according to islam through several steps including male circumcision the quran discusses this covenant in detail in several places including sura ibrahim abraham there are two hadiths which are linked to the acceptance of male circumcision in islam they also show how circumcision may have been used to keep track of dates in tribal arabia ibn jubayr sa id

circumcised when they became sexually mature sahih al bukhari no and further ibn abbas reported when the prophet peace be upon him died i was circumcised at that particular time sahih al bukhari no

different laboratories two mrna vaccines one by pfizer and one by moderna were approved late in both are over effective a few vaccines also went into use in early several countries plan to give the vaccine to many people but their plans are different the united kingdom plans to use its national health service canada plans to use its military the united states plans to send vaccine to all fifty states and then let the state governments each make their own system the united kingdom approved the pfizer vaccine before the european union or united states did they began giving it to people on december the united states began giving people the vaccine on december starting with health care workers in new york city by april several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated in late february the world health organization who said it did not expect a vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov the causative virus to become available in less than months the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi which is organizing a us billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidates indicated in april that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than months or by early on may the who organized a telethon fundraising event broadcasted via televisions to raise us billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent covid infections and deaths the united states government started operation warp speed to develop a vaccine by january pittcovacc is a vaccine invented by scientists from the university of pittsburgh in pennsylvania in the united states it was invented to protect people from sars cov the virus that causes covid it was the first vaccine candidate meaning vaccine that scientists thought would work well published in a peer reviewed study meaning a scientific paper that other vaccine experts had read and approved before it was printed for people to read as of april it has been tested in mice but not in human beings pittcovacc is short for pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine one of the head scientists dr andrea gambotto said they made the vaccine so quickly because they had worked on other coronaviruses before we had previous experience on sars cov in and mers cov in these two viruses which are closely related to sars cov teach us that a particular protein called a spike protein is important for inducing immunity against the virus we knew exactly where to fight this new virus that s why it s important to fund vaccine research you never know where the next pandemic will come from the researchers used laboratory equipment to make pieces of the same proteins that are in sars cov they put the proteins inside the bodies of laboratory mice using a microneedle array meaning a small patch with about tiny needles made out of other protein and sugar one of the scientists dr emrullah korkmaz said these needles melt away inside the skin after they release the vaccine the skin is a good place to put a vaccine because it has many immune cells in it then the mice made antibodies or protective molecules in their blood the scientists measured the amount of antibodies and guessed it would be enough to fight off the sars cov virus if the mice were exposed to it it took about two weeks for the mice to make lots of antibodies the scientists said it would be easy to make large amounts of vaccine and large numbers of microneedle arrays to use on people another team of scientists led by dr josef penninger of the university of british columbia invented a medicine called apn they tested apn in engineered human tissue this is human cells put together to act like part of the body but it is not a whole animal or person they added a protein called human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme hrsace and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells they named their hrsace apn other scientists have developed vaccines that use messenger rna to teach the body to recognize the virus they say mrna vaccines take less time to develop and make than protein or whole virus vaccines messenger rna vaccines need to be stored at very cold temperatures ordinary refrigerators are not cold enough in mid may a company called moderna said they tested their mrna vaccine in forty five people and eight of them produced antibodies but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal anna durbin of johns hopkins university said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work the united states food and drug administration gave moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people moderna s chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in january the moderna vaccine entered stage three clinical trials on june that means it is being tested on humans dr anthony fauci said he did not think the vaccine would be dangerous on november moderna said its vaccine was effective the vaccine has to kept colder than freezing but it does not have to be kept as cold as the pfizer vaccine distribution began in february the german company biontech and pfizer made a deal with the united states government to make million doses of mrna vaccine by december the vaccine completed phase i trials and started its next trial on july instead of being a phase ii trial or a phase iii trial pfizer s team is trying to do both phases at once if the companies can make the vaccine on time the u s government will give them almost us billion the vaccine is called bnt b biontech paid its employees overtime to do extra work they called this project lightspeed because they wanted to develop the vaccine quickly because they wanted people to trust the virus pfizer published the study protocols publicly that means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus this is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work on november pfizer announced that bnt was effective at preventing people from catching covid they asked the fda to approve the vaccine for emergency use the company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper so the fda said they needed time to look at the results for themselves the adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold it does not harm the human body much scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus then they inject the adenovirus into a human body the human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses then it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them in late april a team from the university of oxford said that they had developed a covid vaccine the united states national institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys and it worked because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus they had a head start working on one for sars cov they would try to test their vaccine on people by the end of may and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in september the team took the spike protein from sars cov and put it on an adenovirus then they injected that virus into test patients the idea is that the patients immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on this vaccine completed phase i trials and as of july is entering phase iii trials the vaccine is called chadox ncov the chinese company cansino biologics is making a viral vector vaccine this vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from sars cov on it then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein as of july this vaccine is in phase ii trials but the chinese government gave cansino biologics permission to give it to people anyway they are allowed to give it to people in the chinese military the johnson johnson covid vaccine is made from the johnson johnson company unlike many vaccines it doesn t need special unusual refrigeration the company sinovac in china and bututan research center in brazil worked together this is an inactivated virus vaccine this means the team took sars cov and changed it to make it harmless the patient s body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful wild virus too the company got permission to start phase iii trials on july this virus is called coronavac the company sinopharm belongs to the government of china it is an inactivated virus vaccine this vaccine started phase iii trials in the middle of july this vaccine does not have a name the university of melbourne and murdoch children s research institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis the bacillus calmette guerin vaccine it is a live bacterium vaccine that means weak but not dead mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria are injected into the patient then their immune system learns to fight it over the years scientists saw that the bacillus calmette guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis it protected them from other diseases too the scientists at the murdoch children s research institute and university of melbourne are studying the bacillus calmette guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from covid because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years doctors already knew it was safe to use as of july this vaccine is in phase iii trials to see if it works on covid scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient s nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient s veins after a nasal vaccine the body s immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth the nose and mouth are where most people are infected with sars cov scientists are not sure why this works as of july teams in the netherlands the united states and canada are making nasal vaccines as of january th israel is currently the leader in percentage of people vaccinated followed by the usa and then the united kingdom israel has reportedly vaccinated about of it s population or million people", " detoxification is when any toxic thing

outside of the body fgm is also called female genital cutting and female circumcision it is done for traditional reasons as part of a ritual not for medical reasons fgm is most common in african countries as well as yemen and iraqi kurdistan however it also happens in other countries in asia the middle east and around the world usually fgm is not done by a doctor or in a hospital it is often done with a razor blade or other sharp instruments in many cases without anesthesia different ethnic groups do different kinds of fgm they also do fgm at different ages some groups do fgm when infants are only a few days old others do it when girls reach puberty or are older in about half the countries where fgm happens most girls have fgm before they are five years old fgm can cause serious health problems like infections chronic pain trouble getting pregnant and giving birth bleeding so bad that it can kill fgm does not make a person s health better in any way fgm is illegal in most of the countries where it happens however these laws are often ignored since the s many countries have tried to stop fgm in the united nations general assembly said that fgm is a human rights problem and voted to try harder to stop it the world health organization and the maputo protocol to the african charter on human and peoples rights also say that fgm must be stopped there are many different types of female genital mutilation the world health organization who has created four basic categories of fgm called types iv in type i fgm part or all of the clitoris is cut off the clitoris is the female organ that makes sex feel good for women without it a woman usually cannot have an orgasm there are a few forms of type ii fgm all of them involve cutting off part or all of the inner labia the two flaps of skin on the sides of the opening to the vagina the forms of type ii fgm are type iii fgm is usually called infibulation it is the most severe form of fgm the genitals outside a woman s body are cut off and the wound is sewn shut with thread and thorns the different types of infibulation are when the labia are sewn shut one small hole is left open so the girl can urinate and menstruate the hole is kept open by putting something like a twig into the wound to help the wound close the girl s legs are tied together often from hip to ankle for up to six weeks after the woman gets married her vagina is cut open so she can have sex a midwife might cut open the vagina with a knife or the woman s husband might tear it open with his penis if the woman gets pregnant the vagina is opened more for childbirth and then often sewn back up afterward this is called re infibulation type iv fgm is anything else that is done to hurt the genitals like scraping burning scarring or cutting the genitals without cutting them off this procedure will be heartbreaking for women when they get to know about this in later life in many countries where fgm is common almost every woman and girl in the country has had fgm in other countries millions of women and girls have had fgm over many years in countries in africa and the middle east over million women and girls have had fgm this includes in some of these same countries fgm is very common it is most common in these countries however in other countries fgm is not as common for example of the countries where fgm happens most often it is least common in these countries fgm can hurt women s physical and mental health throughout their lives the type of complications that a girl or woman might have from fgm depend on many things like short term complications are health problems caused by fgm soon after the fgm happened common short term complications include more serious short term complications can cause symptoms that can kill a woman they include nobody knows how many girls and women die from fgm late complications happen later on after fgm is done for example painful periods are common because it is very difficult for the monthly menstrual blood to get out of the tiny hole left by infibulation blood can fill the vagina and uterus and stay there without moving if the vagina gets completely blocked the vagina and uterus can fill up completely with menstrual blood because women with this problem do not menstruate and blood builds up in their abdomen making it swell it can be confused with pregnancy fgm may increase a woman s risk of having problems during pregnancy and childbirth for example women who had infibulations are more likely to fgm also raises the risk that a woman s baby will die soon after it is born in the who estimated that babies out of every die because their mothers had fgm all types of fgm were found to raise babies risk of death which was there is not much information about the effects of fgm on women s and girls mental health however a few small studies have found that women with fgm often have anxiety depression and post traumatic stress disorder ptsd studies on how fgm affects women s ability to have sex have also been small in total in there had been studies involving women from seven countries when all the information from these studies was put together researchers found that

to have good training to give first aid in addition to books and videos good training includes a good teacher and the chance to practice for example cpr is practiced on a dummy called a mannequin so a student can learn to push down on someone s chest in an emergency without actually doing it to a person the teacher makes sure the first aid student is doing the skill correctly training can be given by an organization or by a professional medical person like a doctor a nurse or a paramedic organizations that teach first aid include the international red cross schools hospitals the military scout

body has about trillion cells and carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines alone the microbiome is the ecological community of commensal symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space the term was originally coined by joshua lederberg he thought the microorganisms living in the human body in health and disease were important many scientific articles distinguish microbiome and microbiota to describe either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that live in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves respectively however by the original definitions these terms are largely synonymous some of these organisms are useful for humans however most have no known effect they are just symbionts they live with us those which are expected to be present are members of the normal flora under normal circumstances they do not cause disease but may even help our health studies in asked whether our health is damaged if we reduce this biota this is certainly the case with gut flora although flora refers to plants rather than bacteria the term gut flora is widely used and familiar to biologists biota refers to the total collection of organisms in an ecosystem the term microbiota is best for bacteria and other microorganisms but no doubt flora will often be used the microbes being discussed are generally non pathogenic do not cause disease unless they grow abnormally they exist in harmony and symbiotically with their hosts researchers have learned that much of the population of microbes found in the human body are not bacteria but a very old class of single celled organisms called archaea they include methanogens which produce methane and may cause flatulence", " in biology hypertrophy is the increase in size of an organ beyond normal growth hypertrophy happens because the cells grow bigger the condition where an organ is bigger because there are more cells is called hyperplasia some cells like adipocytes fat cells get larger by expanding outward while filling up with more lipid contents while myocytes muscle cells can fuse with other myocytes to form huge myotube cells organs or tissues can grow larger due to the enlargement of their component cells one of the most common and visible forms of normal organ hypertrophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to strength training or bodybuilding in contrast tissues and organs can also get larger by another mechanism hyperplasia in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number although hypertrophy and

a harmful germ and putting it inside the patient s body without any parts of the germ that cause harm then the patient s own cells learn to identify the germ using its other parts then if a living germ ever attacks the body the patient s cells fight it off without having to learn what it is first some vaccines do this by putting a dead weak germ inside the patient s body other vaccines do this

but then crept back up over recently however she shed pounds using weight watchers which means she first gained weight then she lost weight and finally she gained it back basically morrison is describing that the yo yo effect is gaining and losing weight over and over again the body needs less energy after losing weight on a diet people have less fatty tissue and often less muscle after the diet muscle tissue needs more energy than fatty tissue reducing the amount of muscle tissue therefore reduces the need for energy also limit the number of calories people take in at some point a dieter s body will change the way it uses energy if there are less calories to burn the body does this to make sure it survives when less food is available these changes in the body cause people to gain weight rapidly when they stop dieting and return to their old eating habits people can avoid the yo yo effect by changing their diet if a diet works without the body switching to a more efficient way of using calories there will be no yo yo effect a diet should change the dieter s eating habits for a long time new eating habits should not give the body more energy than it needs at the end of the diet it also makes sense to raise the number of calories someone eats slowly exercise and sports can increase the amount of calories burned by the body rather than turned into fat"]}, {"name":

made from pine spruce and eucalyptus other things often used include rags ", " refining is the name for a number of processes that purify or concentrate a substance the name is used for natural resources food and technical products the place where this is done is often called a refinery petroleum contains hydrocarbons after distillation it still contains chemical compounds with sulfur oxygen and nitrogen as well as other unwanted compounds such as alkalenes processed petroleum is used for lubricants the substances mentione are unwanted in lubricants as they can speed up the aging process for this reason they are extracted using a process called hydrogenation in hydrogenation hydrogen sulfide and ammonia gases are produced these gases require special handling as they are very toxic vegetable oils and fats are produced by chemical or mechanical extraction from plants this produces a kind of oil that still has many unwanted substances such as pigments and smell which influence the quality of the refined product in essence the factors influenced are taste shelf life smell and color as well as the ability to use the oil for further technical transformations depending on the process between four and eight percent of usable vegetable oil is lost there are two basic procedures to refine vegetable oil chemical refining and physical refining sugar is washed and treated with concentrated syrup its colored because most customers expect sugar to be white the white sugar sold in shops in almost pure sucrose it has an extent of percent of its weight there are two basic processes to refine metals refining by fire and refining by electrolysis higher grades of purity require both processes lower grades use only the first process salt that is gained through evaportation of seawater needs to be cleaned this is done by dissloving it in brine and then forcing it to crystallize after the process it is no lnoger possible to distinguish it from the salt extracted from

prevent diseases and the best ways to return to a healthy condition people who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care professionals many doctors specialize in one kind of medical work for example pediatrics is the medical specialty about the health of children in this specialty the doctor is trained to provide anaesthesia and sedation this is important for surgeries and certain medical procedures anaesthesiologists also provide pre operative assessments ensuring the patient is safe during the operation and successfully awakens from anaesthesia after the operation they assess for medical conditions and suitability for anaesthesia they screen for risk factors prior to surgery and try to optimize the operative environment for the patient and the surgeon they are the doctors who give epidurals during labor and delivery provide spinal blocks local nerve blocks and general anaesthesia for procedures they are the doctors who are especially trained in intubation putting a tube into the lungs to help a person artificially breathe when the person is paralyzed and asleep during surgery hence due to their skill in intubation they are often the first line responders for emergencies they help people who are in distress with their breathing who have lost their airway or when their airway has become obstructed a cardiologist is a doctor with special training on the heart the doctor in this field ensures the heart is healthy and functions properly the heart is a vital organ whose role is to pump blood to the rest of the body the purpose of blood is to deliver oxygen to the tissues without the heart functioning well our tissues and organs would die and not function properly cardiologists treat heart attacks sudden cardiac arrests arrhythmias rhythm issues related to a faulty electrical system of the heart heart failure where the heart fails to pump blood forward properly and many other heart related illnesses they specialize in life saving procedures like cardiac stents and cardiac ablation there is a subspecialty within cardiology called interventional cardiology these are cardiologists who specialize in interventions or procedures to save the function of the heart such as cardiac stenting or angiography this specialty consists of well trained doctors who practice cardiac surgery they are best known for their role in cardiac bypass surgeries in cardiac bypass the surgeon restores blood flow to the area of the heart that was deficient due to a blocked coronary artery this is usually done by taking a vein most commonly the saphenous vein from the leg to create a pathway of blood flow to the heart region that needs it emergency room doctors are in charge of sudden important or life threatening emergencies in addition to dealing with heart attacks strokes traumas issues that require immediate medical attention or surgeries they also deal with a wide range of other health conditions such as mental health and drug overdoses their training is broad and diverse as anyone can walk through the door seeking help they see patients of all ages and walks of life however unlike a general practitioner or family doctor their immediate goal is to make sure the patient is stable and exclude any serious or life threatening diseases or conditions a family doctor otherwise known as general practitioner is trained to provide medical service to people of all ages demographics and walks of life their training is diverse to deal with a variety of conditions including all non surgical specialties they also follow the patient from birth to death and are trained to treat an individual as a whole in the context of their social setting and also their family situation and mental health unlike specialists who mainly deal with problems of one organ or system family doctors deal with all parts of the body and synthesize this information for the patient s general health they provide a global perspective of the person s health in the patient s unique life situation they are an individual s regular doctor who knows the patient in their social and family context they can refer to specialists for issues that require more detailed or specialized treatments unavailable to them as an outpatient or beyond their expertise gastroenterologists are

childbirth today the apgar score is very commonly used by doctors nurses midwives emergency medical technicians emts and other medical professionals one of the reasons it is so popular is that doing an apgar test is very quick it usually takes less than a minute sometimes just seconds when an apgar test is done five simple things about the newborn baby are checked the newborn gets a score of or on each of these give things the scores are added up and the total is the newborn s apgar score apgar is the name of the woman who invented the apgar scale but apgar is also a backronym that stands for the things the apgar scale checks these are appearance pulse grimace activity and respiration the apgar test is usually done one minute after birth and again five minutes after birth it may be repeated later if the score is low and stays low the main goal of the apgar score is to see whether the newborn needs medical help usually if a newborn has a low apgar score one minute after birth this does not mean the baby is going to have long term health problems this is especially true if the apgar score is better five minutes after birth but an apgar score that stays below at later times like or minutes after birth may show that the newborn has brain damage these newborns are a little more likely to have cerebral palsy however the apgar test cannot predict say for sure whether a baby

the cause is genetic inherited birth defect or environmental causes in the environment that is outside the foetus if a condition is said to be congenital that is neutral language often it is not known what causes a condition found at birth in common use it is often redirected to birth defect that term is also neutral as to cause there are two main types of congenital defect the first is caused by genetic abnormalities which are hereditary the second may be caused by conditions such as infectious diseases which a baby may get however we may not know what caused the condition sometimes doctors may find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth they use prenatal diagnosis and screening tests such as amniocentesis some gene alleles versions of a gene can damage the baby conditions like dwarfism are nearly always genetic in origin one type achondroplasia happens when a child s bones does not grow correctly another type is caused by pituitary malfunction where the pituitary gland which puts out growth hormones does not work properly many genetic disorders are caused by mutations or changes in gene alleles mutations can cause development to go wrong or a simple biochemical deficiency the body does not have enough of an important chemical in the case of a chemical deficiency the problem may be curable for example phenylketonuria was a cause of mental retardation doctors came up with a simple test to find which babies have this condition they found that if these children got treated and followed a strict diet they could get enough of the chemical they needed phenylketonuria now causes few cases of mental retardation another type of genetic defect is caused by errors in chromosome copying during the cell division which produces the gametes meiosis cells divide and copy themselves to produce gametes sometimes errors happen in the way that chromosomes are copied during this process these errors are then copied again and again as cells keep dividing and copying themselves the most common chromosomal disorder is down syndrome mongolism this condition happens when a child has three copies of the st chromosome instead of two the other main type of congenital disorder is caused by an infectious disease being passed from mother to child for example if a pregnant woman gets rubella her child can have many birth defects congenital syphilis was common a century ago and congenital aids occurs today and is common in some parts of africa as time passes screening and antibiotics has caused the number of infections transmitted by the mother to drop it is a much smaller proportion than a century ago despite aids also maternal nutritional defects are much rarer except in countries where food supply is limited therefore genetic disorders have grown as a proportion of the total congenital defects sometimes mothers take chemicals which cause the embryo damage any substance that causes birth defects is known as a teratogen drugs taken by the mother may affect development of the embryo pregnant women are not allowed to use some drugs for example thalidomide should not be used by a pregnant woman or it can cause many defects in the foetus if the mother took certain things during pregnancy these can lead to problems with the baby common examples of such things are smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol food related pregnant women should eat well if a pregnant woman does not receive enough folic acid with her food the child can get neural tube defects many women give up cigarettes and alcohol when pregnant because this gives the embryo a better chance of developing normally about percent of all babies have what is called a major physical anomaly this is something that damages the way the baby looks or how it functions its physiology birth defects involving the brain are the most common problems they concern about per live births compared to heart problems at per kidney problems at per and limbs at per all other physical anomalies together occur in per live births birth defects of the heart have the highest risk of death during childhood they are the cause of of infant deaths due to birth defects chromosomal abnormalities and respiratory abnormalities each account for and brain malformations about about of deaths in children are because of a genetic disease this is in modern times more than the number of deaths caused by infectious diseases china birth deformity monitoring centre says that one baby with birth defects is born every seconds in china pregnancies which do not come to term miscarriages have similar causes to birth defects many will be due to failures in the genetics controlling development of the embryo most clinically apparent miscarriages two thirds to three quarters in various studies occur during the first trimester chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first weeks a pregnancy with a genetic problem has a probability of ending in miscarriage genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents this may account for the higher miscarriage rates observed in older women", " in biology a bolus from

clinical trials were first introduced in avicenna s the canon of medicine in ad where he laid down rules for the experimental use and testing of drugs he wrote a precise guide for practical experimentation in the process of discovering and proving the effectiveness of medical drugs and substances he laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new drugs and medications which still form the basis of modern clinical trials one of the most famous clinical trials was james lind s demonstration in that citrus fruits cure scurvy he compared the effects of various different acidic substances ranging from vinegar to cider on groups of afflicted sailors and found that the group who were given oranges and lemons had largely recovered from scurvy after days

help people transform their maladaptive thoughts and behaviours into a better state of being psychologists task patients to try out different situational coping skills and help patients to acknowledge then challenge those problematic thought patterns feelings and behaviors cbt refers to many types of psychotherapeutic systems that deal with cognitions interpretations beliefs and responses these systems come from strategies commonly used in cognitive therapy and behavior therapy combining them this combination is used to identify problems faced in the present and tries to improve the patient s current state of mind cbt has emerged as a common treatment for concerns regarding moods it has become increasingly popular for reasons such as its defined structure and that it is based on common sense research shows that cbt is the most effective form of treatment for those coping with depression and anxiety cbt alone is effective for overcoming depression and anxiety after modules medication alone is effective however science still does not understand the long term effects on the brain and body there is evidence which suggests that cbt may be more cost efficient in the long run in comparison to medication although a combination of medication and cbt seems to be the most effective in overcoming mental illness in particular antidepressants paired with cbt could reduce potential relapses in patients facing depression cbt is often recommended for mood related disorders such as depression and anxiety but it can also treat personality disorders post traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders cbt can take place one on one between a therapist and a client during group therapy or online in the early s austrian psychotherapist alfred adler s notion of basic mistakes and their role in unpleasant emotions made him one of the earliest therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy his work inspired american psychologist albert ellis to develop rational emotive behaviour therapy rebt in the s this is now considered one of the earliest forms of cognitive psychotherapy it is based on the idea that a person s emotional distress arises from their thoughts about an event rather than the actual event itself in the s and s american psychiatrist aaron t beck noticed that his clients had internal dialogues going on in their minds during analytical sessions he discovered that the clients appeared to almost be talking to themselves but they only shared a small part of this kind of thinking with him for example a person might have thought to themselves the therapist is being very quiet today i wonder if he s mad at me and then began to feel anxious as a result cbt is based on a cognitive model of mental illness which beck proposed as shown in the example above the model suggests our emotions are a result of our interpretations of events beck put forward three levels of cognition which are core beliefs dysfunctional assumptions and negative automatic thoughts core beliefs seems to be a common issue in patients an example is beck s negative triad this is composed of what seems to be irrational thoughts about the self the world and the future this may be evident in patients facing depression beck used his model as a starting point to develop cbt so that we can improve our understanding about emotions and behaviour in the s a number of empirical studies into how cognitions affect behaviours and emotions were carried out this is known as the cognitive revolution it emphasised the role that conscious thinking plays in psychotherapy and is known as the second wave of cbt cbt targets different kinds of maladaptive thinking the goal is to recognise unhealthy thoughts and develop them into positive thinking patterns in that sense cbt is scientific because irrational beliefs are thought of as theories which are tested to see if they are true cbt is structured in that it uses an abc format a represents the activating event which triggers b your beliefs this is followed by c the consequences which are your actions beliefs are composed of different types of thinking some examples include catastrophising where small problems are blown out of proportion and all or nothing thinking which involves thinking in extremes when creating solutions the therapist and patient need to come to an agreement on attainable goals they follow a criteria which is characterised as smart specific measurable achievable realistic and time limited specific and measurable highlight the science behind cbt as the goals are used to test the hypothesis achievable realistic and time limited ensure that the patient makes small stages of progress through the intervention one of the key reasons why cbt is so effective is because of its interactive nature this is known as collaborative empiricism the patient and therapist work together in targeting problems and changing negative mindsets this means that patients play an active role in improving their mental health which is a key element that distinguishes cbt from other treatments therapists encourage patients to be active by setting them tasks this may be noting down positive moments throughout their day or producing a list of things to complete cbt combines cognitive and behavioural methods to maximise its effect therapists often set their patients homework which challenge their irrational beliefs when patients feel down because of these beliefs the therapist can produce this as evidence an example of a behavioural method is that therapists help their patients to collect evidence that challenges the use of their avoidance behaviours the techniques aim to prepare patient with the skills they need to target their problems independently in the future cognitive behavior therapy can be effectively used as a short term treatment centered on helping people with a very specific problem and teaching them to focus on present thoughts and beliefs cbt is now increasingly recommended because it is successful in changing the patient s way of thinking as previously mentioned it s effective because patients participate in improving their mental health they are encouraged to be proactive by acting as their own therapist this means that once the sessions are over patients are left with the skills they need to manage their problems furthermore it works because the patient and therapist develop a healthy relationship it is built upon understanding cooperation and empathy therapists show patience when patients struggle to identify their negative thoughts or when adopting new coping mechanisms compromise is also a key element in this relationship if a strategy is not working they are willing to work together to find a better solution it is also effective because cbt focuses mainly on the present it does not dive into the patient s past because cbt aims to improve the patient s current state of mind despite its popular recommendations cbt has faced criticism arguably cbt fails to focus on the patient as a whole this may be because cbt focuses solely on the patient s present by ignoring the patient s past therapists may be overlooking the origin of their maladaptive thinking this makes it difficult to identify solutions if the therapist ignores the underlying issue furthermore cbt is known for its interactive element this may be counterproductive in patients who face mood related disorders which are associated with reduced energy levels such as depression since the emergence of cbt several revisions and models have been made one example is the five areas model this model was created because traditional cbt tends to use complex terms which may be unsuitable for some patients or colleagues who do not specialise in cbt the five areas model aims to be more versatile by using language that can easily be understood in that sense this model is not a new approach instead it is a revision of standard cbt the five areas model specifically focuses on five key elements hence the name these are life situation altered thinking altered emotions altered physical feelings and altered behaviour ", " in medicine the term comorbidity is used to describe diseases and conditions that often occur together with another disease or condition the first disease or disorder is called primary in many cases the primary condition or disease does not cause the comorbid disorders however they may both be caused or partly caused by the same thing for example a genetic mutation or a traumatic experience as an example a patient may have antisocial personality disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder the two conditions are comorbid another patient might suffer from borderline personality disorder posttraumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder the three conditions are comorbid", " in medicine compliance or adherence refers to the fact that a patient follows the advice of the doctor and takes the prescribed drugs in the quantities prescribed compliance is important for the treatment of chronic diseases worldwide non compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care in the world health organization estimated that only about half the patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations in particular low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma diabetes and hypertension are thought to contribute substantially to the human and economic burden of those conditions compliance rates may be overestimated in the medical literature as compliance is often high in the setting of a formal clinical trial but drops off in a real world setting some drugs are difficult to take because they must be taken at a specific time or interval sometimes several drugs must be taken together this is seen as a major obstacle to compliance other factors that may adversely influence compliance are that many patients do not understand the benefits of being treated or they see side effects that they were not told about the drugs costing a lot of money poor communication or lack of trust between the patient and their health care provider efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying drug packaging providing effective medication reminders improving patient education and limiting the number of medications prescribed at the same time", " cow urine gomutra in hindi is used as medicine mainly in india where cows are considered as holy by hindus in addition cow urine is consumed as a drink by people believing it to

something medical diagnosis is the best known field but diagnosis can be applied to any subject whereas a doctor diagnoses what is wrong with a patient a motor mechanic can diagnose the fault in a car in all cases they replace a vague query such as my car will not start with an exact analysis such as it s out of petrol notice the diagnosis is precise enough so the solution can be seen these ideas work even in more subtle cases a boy brings an insect in a box to a natural history museum he asks an expert what is this the expert says you mean apart from it being a beetle when the boy nods the expert looks at the insect under a magnifying glass or a binocular microscope chances are it is a common beetle and the expert can give the boy quite a lot of information about it but if it is not known to the expert a much longer study is needed large reference books will be consulted trays of similar insects will be taken out of store to be compared a full diagnosis needs at least the genus and species if the species is unknown the detailed work of description is needed for publication mostly in biological taxonomy the adjective diagnostic is used for any distinctive trait which places the specimen in a precise category for example a single bone making up the lower jaw is diagnostic of a mammal diagnostics is the name given to procedures which spell out what to do to find the cause of a fault this term is used a lot in computer systems", " doctor of medicine md from the latin medicin doctor meaning teacher of medicine is a doctoral degree for physicians medical doctors the

this relationship is also at the base of medical ethics many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients to respect the patients dignity and privacy this relationship has asymmetric information though the doctor knows more than the patient but has to explain the patient s situation and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done there is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses psychologists there are different legal norms that regulate this relationship examples of such norms are the hippocratic oath the declaration of geneva professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship ideally patient and doctor trust each other if they do this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed if the relationship is too good this can preclude efficiency

called infectious diseases the germ theory states that small organisms cause a reaction in the body of those who are infected the body s reaction to infection is called a disease many scientists and doctors in history figured out that diseases are caused by microscopic organisms even after the microscope was invented people still didn t know that germs caused diseases people long believed that bad air from stinky trash dumps and from rotting meat was the cause of diseases so people thought that covering their mouth and nose with a cloth would help filter out the bad air scientists and doctors would use garlic and perfumes to ward off the bad air but people still got sick and even died so this theory was wrong polluted air is not the cause of disease one problem with the old theories of disease was that people believed that living things were spontaneously generated spontaneous generation is when something like a fly grows from a small speck of smelly meat that old theory is called abiogenesis in the seventeenth century francesco redi february march discovered that flies lay eggs that become maggots prior to this people thought that maggots came from rotting meat he discovered this by sealing some meat in a jar and watching it no maggots were found on the sealed meat he also put some meat in a jar and covered it with gauze maggots were found on the gauze but not inside the jar but when he placed meat in an open jar maggots were found on the meat and inside the jar experiments like this proved that maggots come from flies who lay eggs not from rotting meat later scientists would prove that diseases did not come from the air diseases are spread by infection also in the eighteenth century antonie van leeuwenhoek discovered the first microscopic organisms with a microscope he was the first microbiologist he saw some of the microscopic organisms that cause diseases but he didn t know what they were in nicolas andry thought that some of these microscopic organisms caused smallpox and other diseases over years later agostino bassi figured out what caused disease in silkworms ignaz semmelweis was a doctor who figured out that if doctors washed their hands after touching dead people that other patients wouldn t get sick that was in it was about this time that sanitation and hand washing became popular with some but not all doctors doctors began to use chemicals to cleanse wounds and clean their tools between each patient one of the most famous experiments of the nineteenth century was when john snow discovered the source of a cholera outbreak it turns out that cholera is transmitted when human waste contaminates water that people drink snow found out that there was a large number of sick people in soho in london after talking to many people in the area and mapping where each sick person lived he realized that the sick people were almost all getting their drinking water from the same public water pump he solved the epidemic by having the water pump s handle removed so that the people would get water from some other place it worked and the epidemic was soon over louis pasteur showed that the germ theory of disease was true in he invented a process that heats up a liquid to a high temperature to keep it from spoiling this process is known as pasteurization named after pasteur pasteurization is used to kill microscopic organisms in liquids like milk wine and beer liquids that are pasteurized will last much longer before they spoil later he did an experiment with fermentation in one case he made a broth that he put inside a jar with a very long winding tube so that no particles could pass to it from outside air could get inside the tube but almost no dust the broth he made did not change and no fermentation took place he then took a similar broth but this time he allowed air and dust to go inside the jar this time fermentation took place the thing that caused fermentation therefore needed to come from outside the environment and it wasn t just air that caused fermentation it must be something floating in the air which was very small we now know that small particles called yeast cause fermentation in the latter part of the nineteenth century robert koch and joseph lister would go on and help establish the germ theory of disease as an important part of science and medicine koch s theories are called postulates and helped medical researchers know what causes diseases lister s ideas would help establish sanitation as a major defense against disease koch s postulates and lister s sanitation

cancer or aids people who stay in hospices are expected to die soon but sometimes they get better hospices are different from other medicinal treatments because they mostly try to make people feel better instead of trying to cure them hospice tries to allow people to die with as little pain as possible hospices have doctors nurses and other people who go to patients houses nursing homes and hospitals to talk to people who want to use hospice medicine the hospice movement was started in england in the s by a nurse named dame cicely saunders the word dame at the start of her name means that she did such good work starting hospices that the queen of england made her a female knight a different nurse named florence wald brought hospice medicine to the united states because she worked with dame cicely saunders and liked what she did there are four types of hospice care and all of them focus on different stages of a patient s needs in home hospice the first level of hospice care is in home hospice which means that hospice staff will come to a patient s home to provide care this type of hospice care is typically used in the early stages of hospice helping patients transition from a hospital to their homes continuous care the second level of hospice care is continuous care which is in home care with support with constant care a patient has a member of hospice staff on hand at all times to help assist in symptom management in patient hospice the third level of hospice care is in patient hospice care while it s never a patient s first choice to be in a hospital away from the comfort of their home there are times when symptoms become too much to manage even by continuous in home care in patient hospice allows a patient to be observed by nurses and physicians around the clock ready at a moment s notice to treat advanced symptoms and offer expert insights and care in patient hospice facilities tend to be calmer and more home like than regular hospital visits to replicate a familiar setting s comfort respite care the fourth and final level of hospice care is respite care respite care exists as a sort of hybrid between in patient and in home or continuous home care the point of respite care is primarily to offer relief to caregivers especially for those with no medical background becoming a primary caregiver to a hospice patient can be too physically taxing

trillion cells and carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines alone the microbiome is the ecological community of commensal symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space the term was originally coined by joshua lederberg he thought the microorganisms living in the human body in health and disease were important many scientific articles distinguish microbiome and microbiota to describe either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that live in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves respectively however by the original definitions these terms are largely synonymous some of these organisms are useful for humans however most have no known effect they are just symbionts they live with us those which are expected to be present are members of the normal flora under normal circumstances they do not cause disease but may even help our health studies in asked whether our health is damaged if we reduce this biota this is certainly the case with gut flora although flora refers to plants rather than bacteria the term gut flora is widely used and familiar to biologists biota refers to the total collection of organisms in an ecosystem the term microbiota is best for bacteria and other microorganisms but no doubt flora will often be used the microbes being discussed are generally non pathogenic do not cause disease

basic facts of anatomy and physiology began to be understood by physicians however harvey s work belongs to a later period at the beginning of the period in doctors were ignorant of physiology and had some to us pretty strange ideas in the renaissance a very important theory in medicine was the four humours or four temperaments this theory had begun with the ancient greeks and influenced medical development until the th century according to the theory the body was filled with four different substances called humours when a person is healthy these substances are in balance when there is an imbalance between the humours the person will be sick the sickness can be cured by bringing the four humours back to balance the four substances are black bile yellow bile phlegm and blood the roman medic galen still supported that theory but refined it in many ways rhazes was the first physician to show that the theory of four humors was wrong in his writing doubts about galen he carried out an experiment which would upset this system he inserted a liquid with a different temperature into the body this would result in an increase or decrease of bodily heat which resembled the temperature of that particular fluid rhazes noted that a warm drink would heat up the body to a degree much higher than its own natural temperature the drink would therefore trigger a response from the body rather than transferring only its own warmth or coldness to it avenzoar carried out an experimental dissection and autopsy to prove that the skin disease scabies was caused by a parasite this discovery upset the theory of humorism the removal of the parasite from the patient s body did not involve purging bloodletting or any other traditional treatments associated with the four humors ibn al nafis then discredited the theory of four humors after his discovery of both pulmonary circulation and coronary circulation because there were only a few ways of studying how the body worked early doctors did not know how to cure sickness when a plague started they could not really know what to do for their patients except making them a little less painful one of their mistakes was that they thought the air carried the disease which it sometimes did or that sickness was caused by flying venom so they covered their mouths or burned aromatic leaves leaves that smelled good but did not wash their hands after seeing a sick friend or family member when william harvey practiced medicine in only a few of his friends were trying to find out how the body worked and only a few doctors believed harvey when he said that the blood was pumped by the heart most people thought he was a quack fake or bad doctor slowly they began to see his findings were real in the th century anton van leeuwenhoek and robert hooke developed the light microscope using such a microscope leeuwenhoek was the first to see bacteria in he called them animalcules and published his observations in a series of letters to the royal society the name bacterium was introduced much later by christian gottfried ehrenberg in some cures not only didn t work they could be dangerous to the patient for instance when someone was sick doctors said that bad blood must be removed to remove the bad blood the doctor attached leeches to the patient leeches are animals that suck blood when the leech was full the job was finished but when somebody was sick taking away their blood could make them very weak they could even die as science and medicine grew better leeching was stopped until recently when doctors began sometimes using leeches on patients who had fingers or hands that were cut off and reattached one of the greatest pains in reattachment is just after surgery when the blood pools under the skin and is very painful doctors have found out that using leeches to drink the excess blood helps to make the pain smaller some cures really worked though sometimes wounds that today we would use stitches were held together using beetles that had pincers the edges of the wound were pinched together by a big angry beetle when the pincers were pinching it firmly together the beetle head would be cut off spider webs were used to help wounds clot blood come together doctors are still looking into other cures that were used in the renaissance to see if they can help today s medicine", " medical subject headings mesh is

weather can hurt people and their property it can also just be a bother some examples of severe weather are weather happens because different parts of the earth get different amounts of heat from the sun this makes different climates the tropics get the most heat because the sun shines straight down on them while the poles get the least heat because the sun shines on them from a low angle warmer air is lighter than cooler air and rises higher in the sky by convection the air always has some water mixed with it this is called humidity when it cools the water can change from a gas to a liquid through condensation then the water can fall from the sky as rain or snow after the air rises it gets colder and goes back towards the ground because the air lost its water before it is dry when it comes back to the ground when two air masses of different temperatures meet this is called a warm front or cold front the ways that the air moves around the earth are called atmospheric circulation",

desert and send sand spinning the height of a dust devil can range from a few meters tall to more than meters ft tall they are usually harmless but occasionally they can cause some damage to both people and property a dust devil forms when hot air near the ground rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler low pressure air above it if conditions are just right then the air may begin to rotate as the air rapidly rises the hot air is stretched vertically and because of angular momentum the spinning gets much more intense because the hot air cools when it rises it eventually goes down to the base and expands horizontally while more hot air shoots up the column to replace the lost air the air that is displaced falls to the ground around the dust devil creating a balancing force thus a dust devil is formed certain conditions help the formation of dust devils flat barren desert terrain flat terrain and hot conditions help the hot air fuel being always available the dust and sand helps the dust devil be seen clear skies or lightly cloudy conditions the surface needs a lot of solar energy to heat the air light or no wind and cool temperature in the atmosphere without a cool atmosphere and hot surface the dust devil with never form wind will not keep the dust devil stable a dust devil dies when it eventually sucks in cool air from the surface cool air destroys the dust devil because it quickly discourages the rising of air through the column this usually happens when the dust devil becomes weak or moves across a new terrain were the surface temperatures are cooler similarly when hot air rises rapidly in water bodies and if conditions are just right they are known as water sprout dust devils occur on the planet of mars as well they can be ten times higher than ones on earth and fifty times as wide they can pose a threat to technology placed on mars however not all dust devils are damaging mission members keeping an eye on the mars spirit rover reported that on march a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the solar panels of that robot power levels dramatically increased and much more scientific work was able to be done ", " fog is thick mist it may appear on land or sea and it usually lowers visibility makes it hard to see very far when fog forms at high levels it creates a cloud called stratus when the air chills moisture will turn to fog fog is made up of tiny water droplets or in very cold conditions ice crystals when seen on a high speed camera a special camera that takes many frames and can view videos at very low speed it looks like hundreds of small water droplets moving through the air these water droplets make up the fog or mist there are many types of fog classified according to what makes the condensation they include evaporation fog advection fog radiation fog and upslope fog the thickness of fog varies depending on the atmosphere temperature weather and location crepuscular rays made by tree shadows over fog the morning fog in the rhine valley between lienz altst tten and r thi ground fog in east frisia moordorf a foggy sunrise media related to fog at wikimedia commons", " frost is ice that is formed when water vapor freezes onto a surface it has a white powdery appearance it forms on cold surfaces when the temperature of the air is very low it can destroy crops many plants can be damaged or killed by freezing temperatures or frost this varies with the type of plant and tissue exposed to low temperatures greenhouses help to protect crops from cold and frost damage ", " the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl is a laboratory in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa office of oceanic and atmospheric research oar ", " the greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the earth s atmosphere the air around the earth trap infrared radiation this makes the planet become warmer similar to the way it makes a greenhouse become warmer the greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases the most important greenhouse gases in earth s atmosphere are water vapor carbon dioxide co and methane when there is more greenhouse gas in the air the air holds more heat this is why more greenhouse gases cause climate change and global warming the greenhouse effect is natural it is important for life on earth without the greenhouse effect the earth s average temperature would be around or degrees celsius or degree fahrenheit earth would be locked in an ice age because of the greenhouse effect the earth s actual average temperature is degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit the problem is that recently the greenhouse effect has become stronger this is because humans have been using large amounts of fossil fuels which release carbon dioxide when they are burned since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas it has caused the planet to warm over the past years about years ago before people started burning large amounts of fossil fuels there were to parts per million ppm of carbon dioxide co in the atmosphere but now there is over ppm most scientists say that having ppm or less is safe for the environment and that species on the planet can adapt to this level higher levels can make severe problems for animal and marine life that are already being seen today such as ocean acidification the greenhouse effect was first proposed by joseph fourier in mars venus and other planets with atmospheres also have greenhouse effects the effect on venus is especially strong because venus has so much co this is why venus is hotter than mercury even though mercury is closer to the sun the first person to predict that carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and other combustion processes could cause global warming was svante arrhenius", " a hazardous weather outlook is a statement used by the national weather service in the united states to give information about possible bad weather events that may happen in the next seven days it may be used to give information about possible strong thunderstorms heavy rain or flooding winter weather or very low or high temperatures", " haze is reduction in visibility due to dust or other particles in the air it is often a problem in air quality with smoke covering the sky the particles may also make it hard to breathe some people fall sick as well due to the polluted air ", " heat lightning is the name for lightning from thunderstorms that are far away that is not followed by thunder this happens because the lightning is far away and the sound of the thunder stops before it reaches the person watching the thunderstorm although it is named heat lightning it does not have anything to do with the heat of the lightning itself at night lightning can be seen from up to miles away but the thunder doesn t go that far heat lightning is often seen during the summer months in florida heat lightning can often been seen over the water at night from thunderstorms that formed during the day", " a heat wave is a period of unusually warm or very hot weather and may be accompanied by high humidity heat wave is not an exact term any weather that feels warmer than people expect might be called a heat wave for example temperatures normal for a warmer climate might be called a heat wave by people living in a place that is usually cooler so a heat wave could mean a little warm weather like several days as hot as summer but in winter or temperatures so high they make history such as the hottest summer in a hundred years ", " a hook echo is a hook shape seen on a weather radar of some supercell thunderstorms it is produced by rain hail or even debris wrapping around the thunderstorm a hook echo is a sign that a tornado has formed or is forming if a hook echo is seen on radar the national weather service may issue a tornado warning", " lightning is a very powerful electrical discharge made during a thunderstorm the electric current makes the air very hot the suddenly heated air expands very quickly which causes thunder sometimes lightning happens between clouds sometimes in the rain lighting goes from cloud to ground if it goes from cloud to ground it can strike a person around people are struck by lightning each year about to lightning bolts strike the earth every second lightning has hit the empire state building as many as times a year when lightning strikes the surface rubs electrons from the lightning and a spark of electricity shoots from the lightning to the surface in a thunderstorm the lower cloud has as many as million volts of electricity this electricity is given out either within the cloud to the ground to another cloud or into the air lightning has been known to travel from the ground upwards to the cloud in scientists discovered lightning bolts that shot upward from the top of a cumulonimbus cloud people can make and study lightning with a tesla coil or a van de graaff generator benjamin franklin experimented with electricity and was interested in lightning he discovered many things about lightning in he was the first to show that a thunderstorm lets out electricity in his book he suggested an experiment to test it joseph priestley said that franklin flew a kite to prove the presence of electricity in the storm using a dry silk string to protect himself from the electricity in the wet hemp kitestring", " a lightning strike or a lighting bolt is a line of electric energy that is made during thunderstorms it is very powerful and can kill anyone that it touches it usually strikes tall objects such as skyscrapers trees and mountains a few people have survived lightning strikes ", " a mesocyclone is a vortex of air about to km in diameter the mesoscale of meteorology inside a convective storm that is it is air that rises and rotates around a vertical axis usually in the same direction as low pressure systems in a given hemisphere they are most often cyclonic that is related with a localized low pressure area inside a severe thunderstorm such storms can create strong surface winds and a lot of hail mesocyclones often happen together with updrafts in supercells where tornadoes may form mesocyclones are normally relatively very small in size they lie between the synoptic scale hundreds of kilometers and small scale hundreds of meters", " the north atlantic oscillation is a climatic phenomenon in the north atlantic ocean it controls the strength and direction of westerly winds and storms tracks over the atlantic basin it was discovered during the s by sir gilbert walker ", " numerical weather prediction is the way weather forecasts are made this is done using computer models of the atmosphere such models describe the current weather conditions and how they change over time using equations using the current weather conditions the equations can be solved or approximated to tell what the weather will be like in the near future the relevant physical parameters such as pressure temperature the direction and the speed of the wind are taken to be functions of time these are modelled with a system of partial differential equations this is a dynamic system that is solved numerically most of these equations are implemented using fortran the equations are approximated since the number of calculations is huge supercomputers usually do them to finish before it s too late the atmosphere is modelled as a fluid the basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics can then be used to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future the results are usually too inaccurate to be used for predicting the weather at any place for this reason meteorologists check the values and compare them to historical data in other words they use the data to help produce the weather forecast model output statistics is a statistical model that was developed in the s and s it uses regression analysis for a fully automated forecast with it historical data is analysed automatically one of its applications is called direct model output mos uses both historical data and statistical modeling predictions beyond about six hours are unreliable another well known model is called global forecast system gfs which is run by the us weather service noaa it gives a forecast four times a day since the information is free the gfs is often used especially by smaller weather stations the atmosphere is a chaotic system a small change of the input values does not necessarily lead to a small change of the output this is due to the equations of fluid dynamics that are involved these equations involved are solved or approximated once with the parameters that were observed this is done several times more with parameters that are based on the observed values but which have been changed slightly because the computing power is limited the resolution of such a model is more coarse once all the calculations are finished they are compared to one another calculated results that are similar indicate that the prognosis is relatively good in some cases this means that it is possible to accurately predict the weather for a time of about ten days in other cases a prediction over even a few days may be difficult", " a rainbow is an arc of colour in the sky that can be seen when the sun shines through falling rain the pattern of colours called a spectrum starts with red on the outside and changes through orange yellow green blue indigo and violet on the inside sometimes a second larger dimmer rainbow is seen a rainbow is created when white light is bent refracted while entering a droplet of water split into separate colours and reflected back a rainbow is actually round like a circle on the ground the bottom part is hidden but in the sky like from a flying airplane it can be seen as a circle around the point opposite the sun rainbows often appear after storms and are popular symbols for peace in many cultures the rainbow effect can be seen when there are water drops in the air and the sun is giving light at the back of the observer at a low distance up or angle rainbows always appear opposite the sun they form circles around the shadow of your head which is the point opposite the sun while sunlight is white all white light is actually a blend of many different colours water and other materials bend the different colours at different angles some more strongly than others this is called dispersion by splitting up white light into its separate colours rainbows appear colourful even though the source of light hitting them is white the rainbow displays with the deepest effect in our minds take place when another common place to see the rainbow effect is near waterfalls parts of rainbows can be seen some of the time an unnatural rainbow effect can also be made by spraying drops of water into the air on a sunny day the rainbow has no definite number of physical colours but seven are traditionally listed below is a commonly used list of seven colors in the order seen in a rainbow computer screens cannot show them precisely but can make colors that look similar each color shows the number codes used to tell a computer how to display the color ", " the small dark spot sometimes also called dark spot or the wizard s eye was a

snowmelt can also affect how good and safe drinking water is snowflakes collect air pollution as they fall snow on the ground collects pollution from cars farm animals fertilizer and other things the snowmelt collects dirt and other pollutants on the ground pollution in snowmelt can be a larger problem than pollution in rainwater because the snow collects pollution all winter and then the snowmelt combines with the spring rain and releases it all at the same time then it flows into streams and reservoirs where human beings get their drinking water", " a steam devil is created when spinning air combines with steam or smoke steam devils are almost always found near power plants but sometimes they happen in deserts or near hot springs steam devils can also be caused by cold air especially near the great lakes ", " a sunspot is an area of high magnetic activity on the surface of the sun sunspots produce bright light but not as much as the surface around them so they appear dark by comparison they are cooler than the rest of the sun some are small and some are ten times bigger than earth a sunspot cycle of eleven years has been found with changes in activity every years the number of sunspots increases and later declines sunspots on one cycle are magnetically different from the next so the total sunspot cycle is years this cycle has been seen since the th century before that time for over a hundred years there were very few sunspots astronomers do not know what caused this maunder minimum chinese astronomers said they could see sunspots on march the monk adelmus saw a big sunspot which he could see for eight days adelmus thought that mercury was going in front of the sun and making a black spot when astronomers started using telescopes most agreed that something was passing in front of the sun galileo galilei in guessed that there were actual spots on the sun and that they showed that the sun was turning the first cyclic changes of sunspots was seen by heinrich schwabe and made rudolf wolf study them carefully starting in also in joseph henry showed a picture of the sun and made sure that sunspots were cooler than the rest of the sun they are about degrees fahrenheit c they are still very hot but much cooler than the rest of the sun s surface sunspots are cooler than the rest of the sun but many scientists think that when there are many sunspots the sun actually gets hotter this affects the weather here on earth and also radio reception if this is true then without sunspots the earth might become cooler in the same way if there were more sunspots the earth might become hotter and there could be less rain this would make more droughts on the earth droughts are a long time with no rain without rain crops that people eat would not grow scientists study sunspots and other solar phenomena so they can know what they do to earth the temperature of a sunspot is k this is cold when compared to other areas on the surface of sun", " thunder is a very loud sound that is made sometimes during a very big rain storm thunder is so loud it can be heard from a very far distance it can sound like a boom a crash or a rumble thunder is made when lightning strikes the energy from the lightning heats up the air so much that it makes a kind of explosion when lightning is very near thunder will be heard soon after the lightning flash and the sound will be very loud if the lightning is farther away the thunder will be a few seconds or many seconds after the lightning people can guess how far away the lightning is by counting the number of seconds between the time they see the lightning and hear the thunder", " tornado alley is a colloquial term most often used to refer to the area of the united states in which tornadoes happen more than in any other part of the country the super tornado outbreak with tornadoes took place in georgia illinois indiana kentucky michigan mississippi north carolina ohio south carolina tennessee virginia and west virginia states such as minnesota wisconsin illinois indiana and ohio are sometimes included in tornado alley research suggests that tornadoes are happening more often in the northern parts of tornado alley where it reaches the canadian prairies over the years the location s of tornado alley have not been clearly defined no definition of tornado alley has ever been officially chosen by the national weather service nws thus differences in the place are because of the different criteria used the national severe storms laboratory nssl faq says that tornado alley is a term used by the media as a reference to areas that have mroe tornadoes a study of tornadoes concluded almost one fourth of all significant tornadoes happen in this area no state has no tornadoes however they happen more often in the central united states between the rocky mountains and appalachian mountains another criterion for the location of tornado alley or tornado alleys can be where the strongest tornadoes happen more often the term tornado alley was first used in by u s air force meteorologists major ernest j fawbush and captain robert c miller they used it as the title of a research project to study severe weather in parts of texas and oklahoma the average tornado stays on ground for only minutes these figures reported by the national climatic data center for the period between and show the seventeen u

easterly waves also known as african easterly waves in the atlantic ocean are a type of atmospheric trough an extended area of moderately low air pressure leaning north to south which move from east to west across the tropics creating areas of cloudiness and thunderstorms west moving waves can also form from the tail end of frontal zones in the subtropics and tropics and may be called to as easterly waves but these waves are not properly called tropical waves they are a form of inverted trough sharing many characteristics with fully tropical waves all tropical waves form in the easterly flow along the southern side of the subtropical ridge or belt of high pressure which is north and south of the intertropical convergence zone itcz tropical waves are normally carried westward by the prevailing easterly winds along the tropics and subtropics near the equator they can lead to the formation of tropical cyclones in the north atlantic and northeast pacific oceans they can also lead to tropical storms which can also lead to hurricanes a tropical wave is usually preceded by an area of sinking intensely dry air sloping as a northeast wind with the passage of the trough line the wind turns to the southeast the humidity suddenly rises and the atmosphere destabilizes producing widespread showers and thunderstorms sometimes severe as the wave moves off westward the showers slowly stop a notable exception to the general characteristic of widespread precipitation behind a tropical wave occurs in the atlantic periodically a surge of intensely dry air known as the saharan air layer sal is entrained behind a tropical wave resulting in cloudless or nearly cloudless skies as convection is limited by the dry layer inversion also any dust which may be present within the sal reflects solar radiation slightly cooling the atmosphere below it tropical waves in the atlantic ocean form from disturbances which drift off the continent of africa onto the atlantic ocean these are generated or enhanced by the african easterly jet the clockwise circulation of the large transoceanic high pressure cell or anticyclone centered near the azores islands impels easterly waves away from the coastal areas of africa to north america about of atlantic tropical cyclones originally form from tropical waves while about of intense atlantic hurricanes category and greater form from tropical waves tropical cyclones can sometimes degenerate back into a tropical wave this normally happens if upper level wind shear is too strong the storm can redevelop if the upper level shear decreases or stops if a tropical wave is moving quickly it can have strong winds of over tropical storm force but is not considered a tropical storm unless it has a closed circulation it has been suggested that eastern pacific ocean tropical cyclones are formed out of tropical waves that come from north africa as well during the summer months tropical waves can go northward as far as the desert southwest of the united states producing spells of intensified shower activity surrounded within the current monsoon area", " an updraft or downdraft is the vertical movement of air as weather causes two forces to

be able to see far if there is high visibility such as on a bright sunny day a person will be able to see a long way visibility less than metres ft is often called zero when it is this low roads may be closed or lights and signs are turned on to warn drivers these are put in areas that often have very low visibility warning lights help stop accidents automobile crashes with many cars happen often in places like this if the warning lights and signs are not put up visibility is said to be good when a person can see farther than about kilometers an advisory is put out by meteorologists to warn of low visibility such as a dense fog advisory from the u s national weather service these tell drivers to not travel until the fog leaves airport travel sometimes is delayed or slowed down by low visibility", " a volcanic winter is a climate cooling caused by an extremely large volcanic eruption such an eruption releases ash and sulfur dioxide in huge quantities they form aerosols of sulfuric acid when they reach the stratosphere more sunlight is reflected and some is absorbed by the stratosphere these reactions heat up the stratosphere but lead to a drop in the temperature on the ground the siberian traps emeishan traps and deccan traps are huge flood basalt provinces caused by volcanism they are the cause or part of the cause of several mass extinctions especially the permian triassic extinction event nuclear winter is a theory of similar effects which might be caused by a large scale nuclear war the effects of recent volcanic eruptions on winters are modest in scale but historically their effects have been significant most recently the explosion of mount pinatubo a stratovolcano in the philippines cooled global temperatures for about years in the explosion of krakatoa krakatau created volcanic winter like conditions the next four years after the explosion were unusually cold and the winter of to included powerful blizzards record snowfalls were recorded worldwide the eruption of mount tambora a stratovolcano in indonesia occasioned mid summer frosts in new york state and june snowfalls in new england and newfoundland and labrador in what came to be known as the year without a summer of a paper written by benjamin franklin in the s blamed the unusually cool summer of on volcanic dust coming from iceland where the eruption of laki volcano had

instruments in the sky to send back information on atmospheric pressure temperature and humidity by means of a small measuring tool called a radiosonde to get wind data they can be tracked by radar radio direction finding or navigation systems such as the satellite based global positioning system the invention of the weather balloon started the age of remote sensing the ability to collect information where there are no people weather balloons are a major tool of atmospheric research high altitude balloons have also been used by astronomers and cosmologists to take readings of certain particle frequencies or gather light readings free of excessive disturbance from earth s lower atmosphere troposphere the first observation balloon was launched immediately before the first manned balloon flight by frenchmen jean fran ois de rozier and the marquis d aalandes on november for a pre flight wind reading later french meteorologist leon teisserenc de bort pioneered the use of weather balloons handily proving their utility with balloon acquired data he determined the existence of a lower level of the atmosphere which he termed the troposphere or sphere of change where weather takes place since the s when radio tracking systems were invented balloons have been used as complete floating weather stations using such instruments as thermometers barometers hygrometers cameras and telescopes many agencies use weather balloon flights to model the atmosphere and to make more accurate weather predictions they collect such atmospheric information as temperature pressure and humidity that can then be plotted on weather maps three dimensional atmospheric modeling is also possible using weather balloons because the instruments they carry are able to provide data collected

lived in the past they research in modern cities small villages tribes and in the countryside anthropology uses a four field approach that divides anthropology into four big kinds archaeology is the study of humans from the past people who study archaeology are called archaeologists archaeologists look at things that past people left behind to know how they lived they look at tools bones and past houses to see how people in the past are not the same as people that live today here are some other examples of what archaeologists like to study biological or physical anthropology studies human bodies and how they change over time they look at how humans live in nature and how their bodies change because of where they live they also study how human beings and apes and monkeys are alike

south asia central asia north africa or the horn of africa the group of these persons was called caucasoid race or caucasian race in former times many people divided human beings into three races these races were called caucasoid mongoloid and negroid today scientists agree that there is only one human race modern genetic research has shown that the idea of three races was wrong german anthropologist johann friedrich blumenbach invented the name caucasian race because he saw a connection to the caucasus mountains in the united states white people are often called caucasian but the caucasian race included people with a skin from white to dark brown some persons in the pictures have white skin others have brown skin but in former times scientists saw all persons in the pictures as members of the caucasian race children from georgia in the caucasus region children from somalia officials from minneapolis and the somalian town of bosaso", " culture shock is a feeling people have when they are in a different and unknown culture or place such as a different country culture shock grows out of the difficulties in getting used to the new culture causing difficulty in knowing what is appropriate and what is not the word was used for the first time in by kalervo oberg", " in ancient history a division of labour or specialisation was when some people in a city stopped growing crops and took other jobs this usually happened because of a surplus of food this means that there was more than enough food for everyone so some people did not have to grow crops anymore xenophon was a philosopher of the th century bc in his book cryopedia the education of cyrus he writes about the division of labour just as the various trades are most highly developed in large cities in the same way food at the palace is prepared in a far superior manner in small towns the same man makes couches doors ploughs and tables and often he even builds houses and still he is thankful if only he can find enough work to support himself and it is impossible for a man of many trades to do all of them well in large cities however because many make demands on each trade one alone is enough to support a man and often less than one for instance one man makes shoes for men another for women there are places even where one man earns a living just by mending shoes another by cutting them out another just by sewing the uppers together while there is another who performs none of these operations but assembles the parts of necessity he who pursues a very specialised task will do it best", " ethnography is a kind of anthropology ethnographers study specific cultures ethnography mostly uses participant observation the researcher becomes part of the setting or mixes with the people being studied they try to record patterns of social interaction and the thoughts and experiences of participants ethnographers want to understand these in their local contexts ethnography started in social and cultural anthropology in the early twentieth century it spread to other social sciences especially sociology ethnographers mainly use qualitative methods they may also use quantitative data according to dewan ethnographers do not try to find generalized results they study cultures in context and in a specific situation the best way to use ethnography with quantitative research is to discover relationships then use the results and data to test and explain empirical assumptions the word ethnography comes from greek words ethnos folk people nation and grapho i write", " feminist anthropology is a theory that combines anthropology the study of humans and feminism the political movement for the rights of women feminism began to noticeably make a mark on anthropology during the s feminist anthropology changed how anthropologists study women anthropologists for the most part used to ignore women s work and not bother understanding their social roles the influence of feminist anthropology can be seen in the inclusion of women s stories and perspectives in anthropology before the s most anthropologists were men most anthropology research was about men and because of that the contributions of women were not understood or considered important feminist anthropologists were recognized as a group in the s they were concerned about male bias so they worked to get more women doing research and writing and more academics focusing on the roles of women in their research feminist anthropology is often political and related to activism or making change to help people that need it feminist anthropology led to an increase in research from all over the world that focused on women early feminist anthropologists in the united states and europe questioned whether women were considered unequal to men everywhere in the world or if that was just true where they were from they found that people think of and treat women as less important than men all over the world feminism was needed everywhere unfortunately what a lot of feminists thought about as gender related issues that everyone faced were mostly things that educated white women from the united states and europe knew about and saw as issues other perspectives about womanhood were expressed but they were not as common in academic writing or getting as much attention in anthropology this was a big problem later feminist anthropologists questioned whether the idea of gender is the same everywhere in the world they found out that lots of people have lots of different ideas about what gender is and what is normal for people of different genders to do this means that even though women all over the world are treated as less important than men in a lot of situations this looks different to different women this includes people born in different areas of the world with different religions lifestyles education levels body types skin colors sexualities incomes jobs and physical abilities not all women have the same experiences of womanhood which is one of the reasons that it is so important that feminist anthropology comes from the perspectives of lots of women who have had different life experiences from each other today it does feminist anthropology doesn t only come from the voices of white educated women but there are still more of those voices represented than the voices of all of the other women in the world it has happened a lot and still happens a lot that white educated women tell the stories of women who have very different life experiences than them sometimes they do a good job telling the stories but sometimes they get things wrong or they don t understand the perspective of the women they are talking about feminist anthropologists today aim to recognize and point out this kind of bias sometimes feminist anthropologists talk a bit about their experiences to let people understand their perspective and their potential bias more before reading their paper sometimes they talk about their ideas in unusual ways like with poetry drawings or in multiple languages to let people see their perspective in different ways this helps make anthropology easier to understand for people who don t read academic papers don t speak english or think in different ways than people are taught to think in western schools feminist anthropology today is connecting people all over the world by sharing stories of women and creating ideas to combat different types of male dominance both women and men read and write feminist anthropology sharing and trying to understand the significance of women s stories gives these stories importance when they might not have been heard lets people understand what makes different women happy and what problems different women face uncovers and helps explain similarities and differences in people and might make it easier for people who don t know each other to help each other out sometimes these stories are written by the women they are about autoethnographies and sometimes those stories are written by anthropologists who do their best to record the stories of those women the way they would want their stories to be told this can give women power feminist anthropologists have realized that even when there are female anthropologists from different perspectives doing work that helps women and tells their stories and even though women today get more phd s than men in anthropology they are not published cited or given jobs as often as male anthropologists are this means people still usually learn about women from the point of view of men and women do not get credit for the work they do as often as men do this is one of the reasons why feminist anthropology is an important part of anthropology feminist anthropologists are trying to change this by reading and citing women and pointing out when they see this happening if there were no feminists there may continue to be more men than women teaching anthropology and more papers written by men being read men tend to cite each other and they write about other men a lot of the time so anthropology would be taught by mostly men and about mostly men this would make it so most of our ideas about humans came just from men less than half of the human population feminist anthropologists are some of the people working to make sure this doesn t happen feminist anthropology is important to all four sub fields of anthropology the four sub fields are cultural anthropology biological anthropology also called physical anthropology archaeology and linguistic anthropology feminist anthropology is used most often in cultural anthropology feminist anthropology is used with many other theories in anthropology like queer anthropology agency theory and decolonization ", " forensic anthropology is the analysis of human remains for the purpose of solving criminal cases and identifying the cause of death in order to understand the death of a person forensic anthropologists collect information from their bones forensic anthropologists use bone analysis to learn more about the person who died how old was the person when they died scientists can discover the stages of growth and development that the bones were in when a person died to guess their age bones such as the femur can be measured in order to determine what stage of life a person was in a child s bones would typically be shorter than an adult s bones another way to determine age is to look for cartilage a tissue that is replaced by hard bone as a person gets older younger children will have more cartilage in their bones while adults will have more hard bone using these methods can help guess the age of a person when they died how did they die causes of death are usually related to injury and or disease forensic anthropologists study bone to see if injuries were caused by bullets blunt objects sharp objects or other weapons they may also be able to see if a person had a disease that caused their death some diseases can cause changes in the structure of bone anemia can cause bones in the skull to flatten diseases like scurvy and rickets can cause bones to soften and bend what is the sex of the person who died sexual dimorphism is most obvious in the pelvis of the skeleton and in the skull forensic anthropologists can determine a persons s sex by studying these bones since females give birth their pelvic bones are usually wider and fan out more to allow room for the baby in terms of the skull males generally have larger skulls than females due to the larger amount of muscle that male skulls have to support when did they die in order to find out when a person died anthropologists use taphonomy or the study of the natural processes that affect the condition of human remains wind water soil erosion and sand can all affect the state of bones anthropologists can create a timeline of when these factors to guess when a person died what is the individual s ancestry anthropologists can study ancestry by studying which features of the skeleton are more common in particular populations compared to others forensic anthropologists collect data by measuring different features of the cranium such as width length shape and thickness once these measurements of the cranium are collected the next step is to find an appropriate reference sample in the forensic anthropology databank this databank can group the data from the individual into an existing reference group giving an indication of the individual s ancestry occupational markers when looking at bones anthropologists look for markings left on bones caused by stress these markings are called stress markers or occupation markers occupational markers can be found in cases where muscles or tendons insert into the cortical tissue of bone via the periosteum or where there is hypertrophy of muscular attachments on the bones the cause of the markers left are from repetitive activities over a long period of time", " fosterage is an arrangement in which a child is brought up with a family that is not their own it is different from foster care which is a legal arrangement made for a child s safety fosterage can describe many different arrangements according to the society they belong to in many parts of the world there are societies where the children do not live with their parents this may be linked to the society s special way of life ", " in america the subject of anthropology has been divided up into four smaller subjects this is call the four field approach the four types of anthropology included are archaeology linguistics physical anthropology and cultural anthropology together these four types of anthropology explain how different humans are all over the world and throughout history there are some people who think applied anthropology which uses the information learned from studying anthropology to solve modern problems of health or education it s own subject which would make it a five field approach but this is not as common most students who study anthropology learn about all four big kinds of anthropology but later focus on only two of the subjects this approach was created by franz boas also named the father of anthropology he is famous for making anthropology popular in the united states boas wanted to show people that human activities ideas and choices are different in different places he believed that the people should be studied holistically not just looking at one part of their life but how all the parts or their life fit together and create their culture this includes studying people s history the objects they make their bodies languages stories and customs since the th century most american universities have used the four field approach other countries like england do not divide anthropology in the same way for example archaeology is a part of the subject of history and not anthropology archaeology is the study of how people lived in the past archaeologists people who study archaeology learn from things left by people who lived a long time ago they examine very old objects like pottery stone tools coins books or anything made or used by humans usually these objects are buried in the ground and need to be excavated or taken out these objects help archaeologists understand where and how people lived a long time ago cultural anthropology is the study of human culture culture is the way groups of people live their lives based on what is normal for where they live cultures change as people s ideas change cultural anthropologists look at how different cultures are by comparing things like people s ideas art and food unlike archaeologists who study people of the past cultural anthropologist mostly study people alive today it is also related to sociology and social psychology it is also called social anthropology linguistics is the study of how people speak and the words they use and how their language developed evolved linguists people who study linguistics also examine how language changes what people think and how people change language they also look at how words make sentences  physical anthropology is the study of human body science biology including how people adapt to where they live and how bodies changed over time evolution they do this by comparing bones from very old humans to the bones of humans today physical anthropologists also study non human primates it is also called biological anthropology", " in ancient greece the gorgoneion greek was originally a magic pendant showing the gorgon s head the use of magic against evil or bad luck is generally called apotropaism the gorgoneion was linked with the gods zeus and athena both are said to have worn it as a pendant it was also popular as a royal symbol worn on shields and capes these can be seen on the alexander mosaic and the gonzaga cameo homer wrote about the gorgon on four occasions but only about the head as if the creature had no body jane ellen harrison notes that medusa is a head and nothing more a mask the body was added many years later up to the th century bc the head was shown as being very ugly with her tongue sticking out boar tusks puffy cheeks her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her the direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient greek art in some cases a beard probably representing streaks of blood was added to her chin making her appear as a wild and sexual god like dionysus gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid th century greek vases are not as ugly strange or frightening by that time the gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized the hellenistic marble known as the medusa rondanini shows how the gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman gorgoneia are first seen in greek art at the beginning of the th century bc one of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaeological dig at parium other early th century examples were found at tiryns there is a similar image from the knossos palace dating from the th century bc marija gimbutas even argues that the gorgon extends back to at least bc as a ceramic mask from the sesklo culture illustrates in the th century bc gorgoneia of a basic type of lion mask were found all over greek temples especially in and around corinth pedimental gorgoneia were common in sicily probably the earliest one is in the temple of apollo in syracuse around bc they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles antefix of smaller buildings throughout the next century as well as temples the gorgon image can be found on dress dishes weapons and coins across the mediterranean region from etruria to the black sea coast the gorgon coins were made in cities making her image on coins second only to some of the main greek gods on mosaic floors the gorgoneion was usually near the door as if guarding it on attic kilns a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents the gorgon image remained popular even in christian times especially in the byzantine empire including kievan rus now the ukraine the image was used in western europe by the italian renaissance artists in the th century the gorgoneion was used by gianni versace as a logo for his fashion company gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of the mother goddess cult linked to dynamic life energy she said the gorgoneion is a typical european image jane ellen harrison on the other hand claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks these are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong or as she terms it to make an ugly face at him the marble medusa rondanini gorgon medusa ad from the romano germanic museum in cologne a roman floor mosaic from palencia gorgon head silver coin from athens about bc", " a hand axe is a stone tool of the lower early and middle paleolithic stone age it was a bifacial similar on both sides and held in the hand not with a handle like a modern axe it was held directly in the hand perhaps wrapped in a piece of leather this kind of axe is typical of the acheulean and the mousterian cultures and is the longest used tool of human history hand axes were certainly used for at least a million and a half years they were made by earlier species of man such as homo erectus and homo neanderthalensis neanderthal man it was one of their most important tools the hand axe cultures were preceded by an even older oldowan culture of primitive stone tools to million years ago in africa now it is known that the first stone tools were probably made by australopithecines they are found in the great rift valley of africa from about million years ago new archaeological evidence from baise guangxi china shows that there were occasional hand axes in eastern asia however as the reference shows the artifacts were overwhelmingly choppers and flakes the authors say the stone tool assemblage shows close associations with the pebble tool industry in south china a line known as the movius line divides the old world into two parts to the west are the hand axe areas and to the east are the chopper or flak and chip areas it is supposed that there were at least two different cultural traditions older hand axes were produced by direct percussion with a stone hammer and can be distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border later mousterian handaxes were produced with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner more symmetrical and have a straight border an experienced flintknapper needs less than minutes to produce a good quality hand axe a simple hand axe can be made from a beach pebble in less than minutes hand axes are mainly made of flint but rhyolites phonolites quartzites and other rather coarse rocks were used as well it depends what rocks were available in the vicinity obsidian was rarely used because it is not widely found it produces a brilliant blade but shatters more easily than flint several basic shapes like cordate oval or triangular have been distinguished but their significance is not agreed upon hand axes were no doubt a multi purpose tool research on their cutting edges has shown that in many cases they were used for butchering meat this would include extracting bone marrow which would explain the pointed end and general hacking through bone muscle and tendons experiments at boxgrove quarry would appear to back this up we know for sure that neanderthals at least were hunters of large mammals such as mammoths and that may be true of other hand axe cultures the need for such a heavy tool is thus easily understood wielding a hand axe requires considerable strength but neanderthals were stronger than us in their upper bodies studies in the s at boxgrove in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe showed that the hand axe was perfect for getting at the bone marrow which is high in protein and vitamins and thus was highly prized as a food source", " some scientists spoke of three races of mankind the caucasian race living in europe north africa and west asia the mongoloid race living in east asia australia and the americas and the negroid race living in africa south of the sahara other scientists had different ideas and spoke of four or five races these ideas were popular from the late th century to the middle of the th century because these ideas belong to former times they are called historical definitions of race or historical race concepts today scientists agree that there is only one human race modern genetic research has shown that the idea of three or four or five races was wrong johann friedrich blumenbach s classification first proposed in was widely used in the th century with many variations the mid twentieth century racial classification by american anthropologist carleton s coon divided humanity into five races there was much prejudice based upon this way of looking at the world the europeans and asians both regarded themselves as superior to the other skin colors racism a non scientific theory or ideology was that a particular race was superior or inferior it argued that in the races that make up the human race there are deep biologically determined differences it also states races should live separately and not intermarry a supporter of racism is called a racist these attitudes in turn supported the horrors of african slavery apartheid the jim crow laws nazism and japanese imperialism", " human biology is an area of study that is part of biology biological anthropology and medicine which looks at humans it is closely related to primate biology and a number of other areas human biology research includes there are not exact boundaries between human biology and regular medical research however human biology usually focuses more on health for an entire group of people and on human evolution adaptation and population genetics rather than individual health", " human evolution is about the origin of human beings all humans belong to the same species which has spread from its birthplace in africa to almost all parts of the world its origin in africa is proved by the fossils which have been found there the term human in this context means the genus homo however studies of human evolution usually include other hominids such as the australopithecines from which the genus homo had diverged split by about to million years ago in africa the first homo sapiens the ancestors of today s humans evolved around years ago it was known for centuries that man and the apes were related at heart their anatomy is similar despite many superficial differences this was the reason why buffon and linnaeus in the th century put them together in one family charles darwin s theory of evolution says that such basic structural similarity comes from the common origin of the group the apes and man are close relatives and are primates the order of mammals which includes monkeys apes lemurs and tarsiers the great apes live in tropical rainforests it is thought that human evolution started when a group of apes now called the australopithecines began to live more in the savannah a savannah is more open with trees shrubs and grass this group started walking on two legs they began to use their hands to carry things life in the open was different and there was a big advantage in having better brains their brains grew larger and they began to make simple tools this process began at least million years ago we have fossils of two or three different groups of walking apes and one was the ancestor of humans the biological name for human or man is homo the modern human species is called homo sapiens sapiens means thought homo sapiens means the thinking man paleoanthropology looks at ancient human fossils tools and other signs of early human life it began in the th century with the discovery of a skull of neanderthal man in by zoologists had known for a long time that humans are in their anatomy similar to the great apes there are also differences humans can speak for example but the similarities are more basic than the differences humans also have features with a much older history from early in the life of vertebrates the idea that species are caused by evolution had been proposed before darwin but his book gave much evidence and many were persuaded by it the book was on the origin of species by means of natural selection published in november in this book darwin wrote about the idea of evolution in general rather than the evolution of humans light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history was all darwin wrote on the subject nevertheless the implication of the theory was clear to readers at the time several people discussed the evolution of humans among them were thomas huxley and charles lyell huxley convincingly showed many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes in his book evidence as to man s place in nature when darwin published his own book on the subject the descent of man and selection in relation to sex the idea of human evolution was already well known the theory was controversial even some of darwin s supporters such as alfred russel wallace and charles lyell did not like the idea that human beings have evolved their impressive mental capacities and moral sensibilities through natural selection since the th century scientists thought the great apes to be closely related to human beings in the th century they speculated that the closest living relatives of humans were either chimpanzees or gorillas both live in central africa in tropical rainforests in fact chimpanzees are closest to us biologists believed that humans share a common ancestor with other african great apes and that fossils of these ancestors would be found in africa which they have been it is now accepted by virtually all biologists that humans are not only similar to the great apes but actually are great apes the issue was confirmed by late th century studies on the sequences of proteins and genes in apes and man these studies showed that man shares about to of these structures with chimpanzees this is a much closer relationship than with any other type of animal and fully supports the ideas put forward in the th century by darwin and huxley primates have diversified in habitats such as trees and bushes they have many features which are adaptations to their environment here are some of those traits not all primates have these anatomical traits nor is every trait unique to primates primates are frequently highly social live in groups with flexible dominance hierarchies closely related animals almost always have closely related parasites this usually comes about because parasites evolve with their hosts and when host populations split their parasites split also it is also possible for parasites to get from one species to another two of the most serious parasitic infections of humans in africa have originated in apes each may have been transferred to humans by a single cross species event there are several species of mosquito and several species of the malarial parasite plasmodium the most serious type p falciparum which kills many millions of people each year originated in gorillas it is now virtually certain that chimpanzees are the source of hiv the major cause of aids this information is got by the sequence analysis of ape and human viruses the relevance of this to evolution is that our physiology is so close to the apes that their parasites were able to transfer to humans with great success humans have much less resistance to these parasites which are ancient in origin but comparatively new to our species it was not until the s that hominid fossils were discovered in africa in raymond dart described australopithecus africanus the specimen was called the taung child an australopithecine infant discovered in a cave deposit being mined for concrete at taung south africa the remains were a remarkably well preserved tiny skull and a cast of the inside of the individual s skull although the brain was small cm its shape was rounded unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas and more like a modern human brain also the specimen had short canine teeth and the position of the foramen magnum was evidence of bipedal locomotion all of these traits convinced dart that the taung baby was a bipedal human ancestor a transitional form between apes and humans it took another years before dart s claims were taken seriously this was after other similar skeletons had been found the most common view of the time was that a large brain evolved before bipedality the ability to walk on two feet more or less upright it was thought that intelligence similar to that of modern humans was necessary for bipedalism this turned out to be wrong bipedality came first the australopithecines are now thought to be immediate ancestors of the genus homo the group to which modern humans belong both australopithecines and homo sapiens are part of the tribe hominini but recent data has brought into doubt the position of a africanus as a direct ancestor of modern humans it may well have been a cousin the australopithecines were originally classified as either gracile or robust the robust variety of australopithecus has since been reclassified as paranthropus although it is still regarded as a subgenus of australopithecus by some authors in the s when the robust specimens were first described the paranthropus genus was used during the s the robust variety was moved into australopithecus the recent trend has been back to the original classification as a separate genus it was carolus linnaeus who chose the name homo today there is only one species in the genus homo sapiens there were other species but they became extinct the figure shows where some of them lived and at what time some of the other species might have been ancestors of h sapiens many were likely our cousins they developed away from our ancestral line anthropologists are still investigating the exact line of descent a consensus on which should count as separate species and which as subspecies has not been reached yet in some cases this is because there are very few fossils in other cases it is due to the slight differences used to classify species in the homo genus the evolution of the genus homo took place mostly in the pleistocene the whole genus is characterised by its use of stone tools initially crude and becoming ever more sophisticated so much so that in archaeology and anthropology the pleistocene is usually referred to as the palaeolithic or the stone age homo habilils was likely the first species of homo it developed from the australopithecus about million years ago it lived until about million years ago it had smaller molars back teeth and larger brains than the australopithecines there are two proposed species that lived from to million years ago their relation has not been clarified one of them is called homo rudolfensis it is known from a single incomplete skull from kenya scientists have suggested that this was just another habilis but this has not been confirmed the other is currently called homo georgicus it is from georgia and may be an intermediate form between h habilis and h erectus or a sub species of h erectus homo erectus was first discovered on the island of java in indonesia in the discoverer eugene dubois originally called it pithecanthropus erectus based on its morphology that he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and apes homo erectus lived from about million to years ago the earlier specimens from to million years ago are sometimes seen as a different species or a subspecies called homo ergaster or homo erectus ergaster in the early pleistocene mya in africa asia and europe presumably some populations of homo habilis evolved larger brains and made more elaborate stone tools these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species h erectus in addition h erectus was the first human ancestor to walk truly upright this was made possible by the evolution of locking knees and a different location of the foramen magnum the hole in the skull where the spine enters they may have used fire to cook their meat a famous example of homo erectus is peking man others were found in asia notably in indonesia africa and europe many paleoanthropologists are now using the term homo ergaster for the non asian forms of this group they reserve h erectus only for those fossils found in the asian region that meet certain requirements as to skeleton and skull which differ slightly from ergaster homo neaderthalensis usually called neanderthal man lived from about to about years ago also less usual as homo sapiens neanderthalensis there is still some discussion if it was a separate species homo neanderthalensis or a subspecies of h sapiens while the debate remains unsettled evidence from mitochondrial dna and y chromosomal dna sequencing indicates that little or no gene flow occurred between h neanderthalensis and h sapiens and therefore the two were separate species in dr mark stoneking then an associate professor of anthropology at pennsylvania state university stated more investigation of a second source of neanderthal dna supported these findings a genetic analysis of a piece of finger bone found in siberia has produced a surprise result it dates to about years ago at a time when neanderthals and modern man were living in the area german researchers found its mitochondrial dna did not match either that of our species or that of neanderthals if this result is correct the bone belongs to a previously unknown species the degree of difference in the dna suggests this species split off from our family tree about a million years ago well before the split between our species and neanderthals homo floresiensis which lived about years ago has been nicknamed hobbit for its small size its size may be a result of island dwarfism the tendency for large mammals to evolve smaller forms on islands h floresiensis is intriguing both for its size and its age it is a concrete example of a recent species of the genus homo that shows derived traits not shared with modern humans in other words h floresiensis share a common ancestor with modern humans but split from the modern human lineage and followed a different evolutionary path the main find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about years of age found in it has been dated to approximately years old the living woman was estimated to be one meter in height with a brain volume of just cm this is small for a chimpanzee and less than a third of the h sapiens average of cm there is an ongoing debate over whether h floresiensis is indeed a separate species some scientists believe that h floresiensis was a modern h sapiens suffering from pathological dwarfism modern humans who live on flores the island where the skeleton was found are pygmies this fact is consistent with either theory one line of attack on h floresiensis is that it was found with tools only associated with h sapiens stone artifacts have been found on flores which can be dated to a million years ago these artifacts are proxies which means there were no skeletons of humans but only a species of homo could have made them the artifacts are flakes and other implements in all some of which show signs of being worked to produce a cutting edge this means that humans were present on flores by that date but it does not tell us which species that was homo sapiens has lived from about years ago to the present between years ago and the second warm period in the middle pleistocene around years ago its skull grew and more sophisticated technologies based on stone tools developed one possibility is that a transition between h erectus to h sapiens occurred the evidence of java man suggests there was an initial migration of h erectus out of africa then much later a further development of h sapiens from h erectus in africa then a subsequent migration within and out of africa eventually replaced the earlier h erectus studies of the human genome especially the y chromosome dna and mitochondrial dna have supported a recent african origin evidence from autosomal dna also supports the recent african origin the details of this great saga are not fully established yet but by about years ago they had moved into eurasia and the middle east this was the area where neanderthals homo neanderthalensis had been living for a long time at least years in western europe by about to years ago homo sapiens had reached western europe including britain in europe and western asia homo sapiens replaced the neanderthals by about years ago the details of how this happened are not known at roughly the same time homo sapiens arrived in australia however a recent archaeological dig in kakadu northern territory may suggest homo sapiens arrived in australia years ago their arrival in the americas was much later about years ago all these earlier groups of modern man were hunter gatherers current research has established that human beings are genetically rather homogenous similar the dna of individuals is more alike than usual for most species this may have resulted from their relatively recent evolution or from the toba catastrophe distinctive genetic have arisen as a result of small groups of people moving into new environmental circumstances these adapted traits are a very small component of the homo sapiens genome and include such outward racial characteristics as skin color and nose shape and internal characteristics such as the ability to breathe more efficiently at high altitudes h sapiens idaltu from ethiopia about

before his death in theodora kroeber married alfred kroeber in though she had never met ishi she decided to write a biography of him the book has two parts the first part is called ishi the yahi it tells about the history and the culture of the yahi people the second part is called mister ishi it tells about his life at the museum the first part begins with the history of california before european colonization kroeber writes that though there were few yahi they once occupied a large part of the sacramento valley other more numerous native american peoples probably pushed the yahi into the mountains the first part also describes the yahi language and the landscape where they lived near mount lassen several chapters in the first section are about the destruction of the yahi by white settlers the second part of the book begins with a history of the museum in san francisco where ishi was taken it also tells how he got the name ishi at the museum alfred kroeber and others arranged for weekly public demonstrations ishi would usually demonstrate stringing a bow or making fire with a fire drill finally ishi s friends had to arrange for ishi to work as a janitor so the university would pay to support him in addition to kroeber waterman and pope ishi became friends with other native american friends of the anthropologists such as juan dolores a tohono o odham indian ishi spent much of his time at the museum making tools and weapons he also went hunting with his friends the last chapter of the book tells of ishi becoming sick with tuberculosis in late and his death from the disease soon afterwards", " a meme pronounce as meem is an idea or style which spreads because one person copies it from another one idea is that culture builds in a way similar to living things an

one human race modern genetic research has shown that the idea of three races was wrong german anthropologists invented the name mongolian race in the th century later the name changed to mongoloid this means looking like a mongol the word mongoloid was once also used to mean a person with down syndrome this was an offensive term used because people said it was like mongolian idiocy or mongolian

preserved natural mummy of a man who lived about years ago the mummy was found in september by two german hikers in the schnalstal glacier tzti alps near hauslabjoch on the border between austria and italy he is also known as the iceman similaun man frozen fritz and man from hauslabjoch he is europe s oldest natural human mummy and has offered a new picture of chalcolithic copper age europeans tzi was found on a mountain ridge at the border between austria and italy after the first world war austria had to give the southern part of tyrol to italy it is now known as trentino alto adige s dtirol at the time the border was fixed on the watershed of that ridge the problem with this is that the ridge is usually covered by a glacier which was also the case in and when the border was fixed the expert team supposed that the watershed was straight below the glacier the border was fixed that way in and the body was found on the austrian side of the slope measurements were done in they showed that the border is in fact metres from the place where tzi was found on italian territory since there is a new contract which fixes the border between austria and italy in the case of glaciers the border is taken on the surface of the glacier and no longer on the watershed below this also means that the border is now variable and depending on the state of the glacier the place where tzi was found is in austria or in italy tzi s body and belongings are now displayed in the south tyrol museum of archaeology in bolzano in the southern tyrol trentino alto adige s dtirol there was also a long legal struggle by the finders plaintiffs helmut and erika simon for a suitable reward after many court hearings the provincial government agreed to pay erika simon by that time years had passed and her husband was dead in x rays and a ct scan revealed that tzi had an arrowhead lodged in his left shoulder when he died and a matching small tear on his coat the discovery of the arrowhead led researchers to think tzi died of blood loss from the wound which would likely have been fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available further research found that the arrow s shaft had been removed before death and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands wrists and chest cerebral trauma suggested a blow to the head one of the cuts was to the base of his thumb that reached down to the bone but had no time to heal before his death at present it is believed that death was caused by a blow to the head researchers are unsure if this was due to a fall or from being struck with a rock by another person tzi exhibits the oldest preserved tattoos in the world these include marks made from fireplace soot and ash there were groups of short parallel vertical lines to both sides of the lumbar spine cross shaped marks on his right knee and right ankle and parallel lines on his left wrist x ray examination of his bones showed age conditioned or strain induced degeneration in these areas these tattoos may have been related to pain relief treatments similar to acupuncture if so this is at least years before their previously known earliest use in china c bc dna sequence analysis has shown that tzi had brown eyes blood type o was lactose intolerant and was likely to suffer heart disease he was more closely related to modern corsicans and sardinians than to populations in the alps where he was discovered his ancestors probably came from the middle east as agriculture became more widespread he was also the first known case of a person

valley of africa from about million years ago they were probably made by australopithecines they are found in europe somewhat later from about mya mya for britain the palaeolithic is by far the longest period of humanity s time about of human history the geological period which corresponds to the palaeolithic is the pleistocene stone tools were not only made by our own species homo sapiens they were made by all previous members of the genus starting with relatively crude tools made by homo habilis and homo erectus in europe the large brained neanderthal man homo neanderthalensis made tools of high quality and was in turn outshone by the many tools made by our own species these tools are the first cultural products which have survived the palaeolithic dates from about million years ago and ended around bc with the mesolithic in western europe and with the epipaleolithic in warmer climates such as africa the palaeolithic age began when hominids early humans started to use stones as tools for bashing cutting and scraping the age ended when humans began to make small fine tools mesolithic and finally when humans began to plant crops and have other types of agriculture neolithic in some areas such as western europe the way that people lived was affected by the ice age the move towards agriculture started in the middle east during the palaeolithic age humans grouped together in small bands they lived by gathering plants and hunting wild animals as well as using stone tools they used tools of wood and bone they probably also used leather and vegetable fibers but these have not lasted from that time the oldowan is the archaeological term used to refer to the stone tool industry that was used by hominids during the earliest palaeolithic period for a long time it was thought that the oldowan was the earliest stone tool industry in prehistory from million years ago up until million years ago it was followed by the more sophisticated acheulean industry oldowan tools were therefore the earliest tools in human history and mark the beginning of the archaeological record the term oldowan is taken from the site of olduvai gorge in tanzania where the first oldowan tools were discovered by the archaeologist louis leakey in the s now it is realised that stone tools were used much earlier million years ago and that was definitely before the genus homo had evolved it is not known for sure which species actually created and used oldowan tools it reached its peak with early species of homo such as h habilis and h ergaster early homo erectus appears to inherit oldowan technology and refines it into the acheulean industry beginning million years ago oldowan tools are sometimes called pebble tools so named because the blanks chosen for their production already resemble in pebble form the final product oldowan tools are sometimes subdivided into types such as chopper scrapers and pounders as these seem to be their main uses acheulean is the industry of stone tool manufacture by early humans of the lower palaeolithic era in africa and much of west asia and europe acheulean tools are typically found with homo erectus remains they are first developed out of the more primitive oldowan technology some million years ago by homo habilis it was the dominant technology for most of human history more than a million years ago acheulean tool users left africa to colonize eurasia their oval and pear shaped hand axes have been found over a wide area some examples were finely made although it developed in africa the industry is named after the type site of saint acheul now a suburb of amiens in northern france where some of the first examples were found in the th century john frere was the first to suggest in writing a very ancient date for acheulean hand axes in he sent two examples to the royal academy in london from hoxne in suffolk he had found them in prehistoric lake deposits along with the bones of extinct animals and concluded that they were made by people who had not the use of metals and that they belonged to a very ancient period indeed even beyond the present world his ideas were ignored by his contemporaries however who held a pre darwinian view of human evolution radiometric dating often potassium argon dating of deposits containing acheulean material is able to broadly place acheulean techniques from around million years ago to about years ago the earliest accepted examples of the type at m years old come from the west turkana region of kenya some think their origin might be as early as million years ago in individual regions this dating can be considerably refined in europe for example acheulean methods did not reach the continent until around thousand years ago and in smaller study areas the date ranges can be much shorter numerical dates can be misleading however and it is common to associate examples of this early human tool industry with one or more glacial or interglacial periods or with a particular early species of human the earliest user of acheulean tools was homo ergaster who first appeared about million years ago some researchers prefer to call these users early homo erectus later forms of early humans also used acheulean techniques and are described below there is considerable time overlap in early prehistoric stone working industries in some regions acheulean tool using groups were contemporary with other less sophisticated industries such as the clactonian then later acheulean tools occur at the same time as the more sophisticated mousterian the acheulean was not a neatly defined period but a tool making technique which flourished especially well in early prehistory acheulean was a basic method for making stone tools which was shared across much of the old world the clactonian is an industry of european flint tool manufacture that dates to the early part of the interglacial period years ago clactonian tools were made by homo erectus rather than modern humans early crude flint tools from other regions using similar methods are called either clactonian or core flake technology the clactonian is named after finds made at clacton on sea in the english county of essex in the artefacts found there included flint chopping tools flint flakes and the tip of a worked wooden shaft along with the remains of a giant elephant and hippopotamus further examples of the tools have been found at sites in swanscombe kent and barnham in suffolk similar industries have been identified across northern europe the clactonian industry involved striking thick irregular flakes from a core of flint which was then employed as a chopper the flakes would have been used as crude knives or scrapers unlike the oldowan tools from which clactonian ones derived some were notched implying that they were attached to a handle or shaft the clactonian industry may have co existed with the acheulean industry which used handaxes however in there was an excavation of a butchered pleistocene elephant near dartford kent archaeologists recovered numerous clactonian flint tools but no handaxes since handaxes would be more useful than choppers to dismember an elephant carcass this is evidence of the clactonian being a separate industry flint of sufficient quality was available in the area so probably the people who carved up the elephant did not have the knowledge to make handaxes the mousterian is an industry of stone tools associated with neanderthal man homo neanderthalensis it dates from about years to about years ago there are up to thirty types of tools in the mousterian as contrasted with about six in the acheulean the mousterian was named after the type site of le moustier a rock shelter in the dordogne region of france similar flintwork has been found all over unglaciated europe and also the near east and north africa handaxes long blades and points typify the industry overall the items are more perfectly finished than any previous work the method used to get the blades and flakes is called the levallois technique it is a prepared core technique the core is worked on so that a long fine blade can be struck off for this quality of work a soft hammer made of something like deer antler is necessary rather than a stone hammer the extra brain size of the neanderthals is probably relevant to these advances the cultures which follow the mousterian are all cultures of modern humans homo sapiens it is characteristic of our species to produce many more tools all specialised for particular tasks there are at least types of tools in the upper palaeolithic compared to a maximum of tools in the mousterian the palaeolithic is sometimes divided into three somewhat overlapping periods which mark technological and cultural advances in different human communities after the palaeolithic follows the mesolithic and neolithic eras which marks the end of stone age the bronze age and the iron age come right after the stone age possibly among the earliest traces of art are venus figurines these are figurines very small statues of women mostly pregnant with visible breasts the figurines were found in areas of western europe to siberia most are between and years old two figurines have been found that are much older the venus of tan tan dated to to years ago was found in morocco the venus of berekhat ram was found on the golan heights it has been dated to to years ago it may be the one of the earliest things that show the human form different kinds of stone bones and ivory were used to make the figurines some are also made of clay which was then burned in a fire this is one of the earliest known traces of the use of ceramics today it is not known what the figurines meant to the people who made them there are two basic theories scientists have excluded that these figurines were linked to the fertility of fields because agriculture had not been discovered at the time the figurines were made the two figurines that are older may have mostly formed by natural processes the venus of tan tan was covered with a substance that could have been some kind of paint the substance contained traces of iron and manganese the figurine of berekhat ram shows traces that someone worked on it with a tool a study done in states that these traces could not have been left by nature alone cave paintings are paintings that were made on the walls or roofs of caves many cave paintings belong to the palaeolothic age and date from about to years ago among the most famous are those in the caves of altamira in spain and lascaux in france p there are about caves in europe where cave paintings have been found usually animals have been painted like aurochs bisons or horses why these paintings were done is not known they are not simply decorations of places where people lived the caves they were found in usually do not show signs that someone lived in them one of the oldest caves is that of chauvet in france paintings in the cave fall into two groups one has been dated to around to years ago the other to or years ago p the oldest known cave paintings based on radiocarbon dating of black from drawings from torch marks and from the floors as of the dates of samples from the cave have been reported the oldest paintings have been dated from years ago some archaeologists have questioned the dating z chner believe the two groups date from and years ago pettitt and bahn believe the dating is inconsistent they say the people at that periods of time painted things differently they also do not know where the charcoal used to paint some things is from and how big the painted area is people from the palaeolithic era drew well they knew about perspective and they knew of different ways to draw things they also were able to observe the behaviour of animals they painted some of the paintings show how the painted animals behaved the paintings may have been important for rituals paleolithic hunting and gathering people ate leafy vegetables fruit nuts and insects meat fish and shellfish as there is little direct evidence it is almost impossible to determine the relative proportions of plant and animal foods there is a modern diet called paleolithic diet but it has few things in common with the paleolitic diet of the time even the claim that most humans of a given period shared the same diet is problematic the paleolithic was an extended period of time during that time there were many technological advances many of which had impact on human dietary structure for example humans probably did not possess the control of fire until the middle paleolithic or tools necessary to engage in extensive fishing source on the other hand both these technologies are generally agreed to have been widely available to humans by the end of the paleolithic consequently allowing humans in some regions of the planet to rely heavily on fishing and hunting in addition the paleolithic involved a substantial geographical expansion of human populations during the lower paleolithic ancestors of modern humans are thought to have been constrained to africa east of the great rift valley during the middle and upper paleolithic humans greatly expanded their area of settlement reaching ecosystems as diverse as new guinea and alaska the also needed to adapt their diets to the local resources that were available anthropologists have different opinions about the proportions of plant and animal foods consumed just as with still existing hunters and gatherers there were many varied diets in different groups of fruit and vegetables the relative proportions of plant and animal foods in the diets of paleolithic people often varied between regions in colder regions more meat was necessary these regions were not populated by anatomically modern humans until bp it is generally agreed that many modern hunting and fishing tools such as fish hooks nets bows and poisons were not introduced until the upper palaeolithic and possibly even neolithic the only hunting tools widely available to humans during any significant part of the paleolithic period were hand held spears and harpoons there s evidence of paleolithic people killing and eating seals and elands as far as years bp on the other hand buffalo bones found in african caves from the same period are typically of very young or very old individuals and there s no evidence that pigs elephants or rhinos were hunted by humans at the time another view is that until the upper paleolithic humans were frugivores fruit eaters who supplemented their meals with carrion eggs and small prey such as baby birds and mussels only on rare occasions did they manage to kill and consume big game such as antelopes this view is supported by studies of higher apes particularly chimpanzees chimpanzees are the closest to humans genetically they share more than of their dna code with humans and their digestive tract is functionally very similar chimpanzees are primarily frugivores but they could and would consume and digest animal flesh given the opportunity in general their actual diet in the wild is about plant based with the remaining filled with insects eggs and baby animals in some ecosystems however chimpanzees are predatory forming parties to hunt monkeys some comparative studies of human and higher primate digestive tracts do suggest that humans have evolved to obtain greater amounts of calories from sources such as animal foods allowing them to shrink the size of the gastrointestinal tract relative to body mass and to increase the brain mass instead paleolithic peoples suffered less famine and malnutrition than the neolithic farming tribes that followed them this was partly because paleolithic hunter gatherers accessed to a wider variety natural foods which allowed them a more nutritious diet and a decreased risk of famine many of the famines experienced by neolithic and some modern farmers were caused or amplified by their dependence on a small number of crops it is thought that wild foods can have a significantly different nutritional profile than cultivated foods the greater amount of meat obtained by hunting big game animals in paleolithic diets than neolithic diets may have also allowed paleolithic hunter gatherers to enjoy a more nutritious diet than neolithic agriculturalists it has been argued that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture resulted in an increasing focus on a limited variety of foods with meat likely taking a back seat to plants it is also unlikely that paleolithic hunter gatherers were affected by modern diseases of affluence such as type diabetes coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease because they ate mostly lean meats and plants and frequently engaged in intense physical activity and because the average lifespan was shorter than the age of common onset of these conditions large seeded legumes were part of the human diet long before the neolithic agricultural revolution as evident from archaeobotanical finds from the mousterian layers of kebara cave in israel there is evidence suggesting that paleolithic societies were gathering wild cereals for food use at least as early as years ago however seeds such as grains and beans were rarely eaten and never in large quantities on a daily basis recent archeological evidence also indicates that winemaking may have originated in the paleolithic when early humans drank the juice of naturally fermented wild grapes from animal skin pouches paleolithic humans consumed animal organ meats including the livers kidneys and brains upper paleolithic cultures appear to have had significant knowledge about plants and herbs and may have albeit very rarely practiced rudimentary forms of horticulture in particular bananas and tubers may have been cultivated as early as bp in southeast asia late upper paleolithic societies also appear to have occasionally practiced pastoralism and animal husbandry presumably for dietary reasons for instance some european late upper paleolithic cultures domesticated and raised reindeer presumably for their meat or milk as early as bp humans also probably consumed hallucinogenic plants during the paleolithic period the australian aborigines have been consuming a variety of native animal and plant foods called bushfood for an estimated years since the middle paleolithic people during the middle paleolithic such as the neanderthals and middle paleolithic homo sapiens in africa began to catch shellfish for food as revealed by shellfish cooking in neanderthal sites in italy about years ago and middle paleolithic homo sapiens sites at pinnacle point in africa around bp although fishing only became common during the upper paleolithic fish have been part of human diets long before the dawn of the upper paleolithic and have certainly been consumed by humans since at least the middle paleolithic for example the middle paleolithic homo sapiens in the region now occupied by the democratic republic of the congo hunted large foot m long catfish with specialized barbed fishing points as early as years ago the invention of fishing allowed some upper paleolithic and later hunter gatherer societies to become sedentary or semi nomadic which altered their social structures example societies are the lepenski vir as well as some contemporary hunter gatherers such as the tlingit in some instances at least the tlingit they developed social stratification slavery and complex social structures such as chiefdoms anthropologists such as tim white suggest that cannibalism was common in human societies prior to the beginning of the upper paleolithic based on the large amount of butchered human bones found in neanderthal and other lower middle paleolithic sites cannibalism in the lower and middle paleolithic may have occurred because of food shortages however it may have been for religious reasons and would coincide with the development of religious practices thought to have occurred during the upper paleolithic nonetheless it remains possible that paleolithic societies never practiced cannibalism and that the damage to recovered human bones was either the result of ritual post mortem bone cleaning or predation by carnivores such as saber tooth cats lions and hyenas", " paleoanthropology or

way research is done by cultural anthropologists in covert participation observation the researcher lives with a group but does not tell the group that they are studying them the research is done in secret this method is good because the people will not act differently than they normally do if they do not known they are being studied one problem with covert participation observation is that it can be unethical the subject cannot give the researcher their consent because they do not know they are being studied in overt participation observation the researcher tells the group of people that they are being studied a problem with this method is that people may change the way they act if they know they are being studied overt participation observation does not have the ethical problems of

objects and will belong exclusively to them totemism was considered a primitive religion by many european thinkers in the s it was thought to be related to beliefs about food and incest taboos in john ferguson mclennan said that there is no race of men that has not come through this primitive stage of speculative belief early thinkers had the idea that beliefs in totemism came from indiginous clans being uneducated about the difference between humans and animals this is not still talked about as true in modern discussions on totemism totem poles are carved with symbols on large trees mostly cedar or spruce by native northwest north american clans totem poles are also found in alaska they are not for worship but early missionaries had them burned down this was a mistake because the poles

is the watchman who warns about approaching danger in the village mile durkheim said in that totemism was just a way of thinking about groups in society durkheim decided this because he spent time working with aboriginal australian clans each clan had its own totem which could be any natural feature such as animals plants or rivers these totems and symbols of them were worshiped and protected this was because only as long as the totem was healthy would the clan stay healthy durkheim decided that the worship of the totems was a type of self worship for the clan claude l vi strauss published totemism in in this book he says that totemism is a way that humans tend to classify people into similar groups once a population has made rules like exogamy marrying outside the group it becomes

a feather headdress some s paras have married persons from other tribes such as the kichwa shuar and achuar however the people still identify themselves as s para s paras have become confused with their neighbors because the young people speak kichwa and because of their low population in fact in the mid s the z para were declared extinct in ecuador while in per they were unknown before

executive board of the development council of nationalities and peoples of ecuador codenpe the s para population decreased because of diseases forced migrations and slavery diseases brought by rubber companies and religious missionaries reduced the s para people to one group the people also were separated from each other when their land was divided in during the war between ecuador and peru the s para nation have asked for rights such as health and bilingual education in addition to demanding the government of ecuador to help them to keep their language alive the s paras are concerned about their right to own the land where they have lived for centuries and about protecting the environment from the actions of oil timber and pharmaceutical companies the s paras have been fishers hunters gatherers and farmers during the s the s paras started to move to cities for study and work at the same time s para men were drafted into the army they also left their communities to work for the shell oil company and large plantations around men used to go to the ecuadorian coast to work for construction companies meanwhile women stayed in the villages taking care of the children keeping the house and farming as a result of such migration most s para men have learned spanish s para people have two different education systems the mainstream educational system and the intercultural bilingual education system of the governmental education division of ecuador while some s paras have moved to cities to attend spanish language high schools others attend kichwa language schools

these remains may include old coins tools buildings and inscriptions archaeologists the people who study archaeology use these remains to understand how people lived when archaeologists do fieldwork they look for remains often by digging in the ground as settlements places where people lived in groups change and grow old buildings get buried usually this is a natural process a typical student project is to leave an object in a place where there is nothing going on it will get covered rather quickly because wind water and plants will bury it sometimes buildings are deliberately buried to make way for new buildings ancient rome for example is now up to feet metres below the present city this process of natural or man made burial is why archaeological fieldwork involves digging and is expensive and takes a long time when things are found or even when nothing is found the results of the fieldwork are taken back to a base short term the base is often on or near the site longer term the results will usually go to a university or museum everything is written down on paper or entered into a computer gradually they build up a picture of what happened long ago archaeologists publish their research so others can understand what they learned archaeologists do not all study the same topics they have specialties some fields of interest include ancient egypt these specialists are called egyptologists ancient china or the vikings archaeologists study every civilization that is known especially the ones where there is no written history they can study any time period for example one might study the beginning of human life in africa or study world war ii marine archaeologists study things that are now underwater they search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea there are many different ways of doing archaeology these depend on the methods used the things studied and the environment some of these subdisciplines overlap with each other archaeology relating to oceans seas and lakes is usually done underwater it includes the study of sunken ships and submerged coastlines maritime archaeology is a part of this subdivision it refers to the archaeological investigation of past ships and seafaring a famous example of maritime archaeology is the recovery and restoration of the ship burial at sutton hoo when a glacier melts objects that were captured in it are revealed the recovery and study of these objects is called ice patch archaeology a famous example is tzi the iceman historical archaeology deals with places things and issues from the past or present at or related to sites with written records or oral traditions or it can be defined as the archaeological investigation of any past culture that has developed a literate tradition a prominent example of historical archaeology is the work done at colonial williamsburg this relatively new branch of archaeology consists of the systematic study of structures and artefacts as a means of enlarging our understanding of the industrial past archaeozoology or zooarchaeology is the study of the relationships between humans and animals in the archaeological record this includes the study of bones feathers teeth and other body parts as well as their interpretation this field involves attempts at replicating the actions and conditions of ancient cultures good examples are butser ancient farm and overton down in many countries governments and other groups of people protect important archaeological sites so they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens because people who are building often don t have a lot of time as soon as the archaeologists are done with their work the remains that they have found will be covered over unless they are very important", " the alexander mosaic is a roman floor

bronze age were replaced eventually by the village cultures of the greek dark ages between and bc the cultural collapse of the mycenaean kingdoms the hittite empire in anatolia and syria and the egyptian empire in syria and canaan interrupted trade routes and extinguished literacy in the first phase of this period almost every city between troy and gaza was violently destroyed and often left unoccupied examples include hattusa mycenae ugarit the gradual end of the dark age saw the rise of settled neo hittite aramaean kingdoms of the mid th century bc and the rise of the neo assyrian empire every important anatolian site during the preceding late bronze age shows a destruction layer it appears that civilization did not recover to the same level as that of the hittites for another thousand years hattusa the hittite capital was burned and abandoned and never reoccupied troy was destroyed at least twice before being abandoned until roman times the sacking and burning of the sites of enkomi kition and sinda may have happened twice before they were abandoned originally two waves of destruction ca bc by the sea peoples and ca bc by aegean refugees have been proposed syrian sites previously showed evidence of trade links with egypt and the aegean in the late bronze age evidence at ugarit shows that the destruction there occurred after the reign of merenptah the last bronze age king of ugarit ammurapi was a contemporary of the hittite king suppiluliuma ii the exact dates of his reign are unknown a letter by the king is preserved on one of the clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many near eastern states from invasion by the advancing sea peoples in a dramatic response to a plea for assistance from the king of alasiya cyprus my father behold the enemy s ships came here my cities were burned and they did evil things in my country does not my father know that all my troops and chariots are in the land of hatti and all my ships are in the land of lukka thus the country is abandoned to itself may my father know it the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us unfortunately for ugarit no help arrived and ugarit was burned to the ground at the end of the bronze age a cuneiform tablet found in shows that ugarit was destroyed after the death of merneptah about bc all centres along a coastal route from gaza northward were destroyed and not reoccupied for up to thirty years none of the mycenaean palaces of the late bronze age survived destruction was heaviest at palaces and fortified sites thebes was one of the earliest examples of this its palace was sacked repeatedly between and bc eventually it was destroyed by fire at many other sites it is entirely unclear what happened it is clear that athens saw a significant decline during the bronze age collapse there is no evidence of any significant destruction at this site fortification at this site suggests fear of the decline in athens it is possible that the abandonment of athens was not a violent affair and other causes have been suggested the peloponnese was the worst affected in greece by far up to of small sites in the region were abandoned which suggests a major depopulation in the region again as with many of the sites of destruction in greece it is unclear how this destruction came about the city of mycenae for example was initially destroyed in an earthquake in bc as evidenced by the presence of crushed bodies buried in collapsed buildings however the site was rebuilt only to face destruction in bc as the result of a series of major fires there is a suggestion by robert drews that the fires could have been the result of an attack on the site and its palace this is denied by eric cline who points out the lack of archaeological evidence for an attack we see a similar situation in tiryns in bc when an earthquake destroyed much of the city including its palace it is likely however that the city continued to be inhabited for some time following the earthquake as a result there is a general agreement that earthquakes did not permanently destroy mycenae or tiryns because physical destruction cannot fully explain the collapse the cause of the continued decline of these sites could be environmental in particular there was a lack of homegrown food palaces were important in managing and storing food imports their destruction made worse the more crucial factor of food shortage the importance of trade is further supported by the lack of any evidence for violent or sudden decline in mycenae the destruction on pylos by fire around suggests a violent destruction to the city there is some evidence of pylos expecting a seaborne attack with tablets at pylos discussing watchers guarding the coast the tablets do not give any context as to what is being watched for and why regardless of what the threat from the sea was it likely played a role in the decline it would have hindered trade and perhaps vital food imports the end bronze age collapse marked the start of a period that has been called the greek dark ages which lasted for more than years the occupation of some cities like athens did continue however their existence was of a much different nature they had a more local sphere of influence limited trade and an impoverished culture it took centuries for greece to recover several cities were destroyed assyria lost northwestern cities which were reconquered by tiglath pileser i after his ascension to kingship control of the babylonian and assyrian regions extended barely beyond the city limits babylon was sacked by the elamites after apparently surviving for a while the egyptian empire collapsed in the mid twelfth century bc during the reign of ramesses vi this led to the third intermediate period that is non dynasty robert drews describes the collapse as the worst disaster in ancient history even more calamitous than the collapse of the western roman empire a number of people have spoken of the cultural memories of the disaster as stories of a lost golden age hesiod for example spoke of ages of gold silver and bronze separated from the modern harsh cruel world of the age of iron by the age of heroes it was a period associated with the collapse of central authority a depopulation particularly of urban areas the loss of literacy in anatolia and the aegean and its restriction elsewhere the disappearance of established patterns of long distance international trade and increasingly vicious struggles for power there are various theories put forward to explain the situation of collapse many of them compatible with each other the hekla eruption was about this time and is dated at bc by egyptologists and british archeologists earthquakes tend to occur in sequences or storms where a major earthquake above on the richter magnitude scale can set off later earthquakes along the weakened fault line when a map of earthquake occurrence is superimposed on a map of the sites destroyed in the late bronze age there is a very close correspondence evidence includes the widespread findings of naue ii type swords coming from south eastern europe throughout the region and egyptian records of invading northerners from all the lands the ugarit correspondence at the time mentions invasions by tribes of such as the mysterious sea peoples equally the last linear b documents in the aegean dating to just before the collapse reported a large rise in piracy slave raiding and other attacks particularly around anatolia later fortresses along the libyan coast constructed and maintained by the egyptians after the reign of ramesses ii were built to reduce raiding this theory is strengthened by the fact that the collapse coincides with the appearance in the region of many new ethnic groups indo european tribes such as the phrygians thracians macedonians and dorian greeks seem to have arrived at this time possibly from the north there also seems to have been widespread migration of the aramaeans possibly from the south east ultimate reasons for these migrations could include drought developments in warfare weaponry earthquakes or other natural disasters this means that the migrations theory is not incompatible with the other theories mentioned here the bronze age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow comparatively continuous spread of iron working technology in the region beginning with precocious iron working in what is now bulgaria and romania in the th and th centuries bc leonard r palmer suggested that iron whilst inferior to bronze weapons was in more plentiful supply and so allowed larger armies of iron users to overwhelm the smaller armies of bronze using chariotry it now seems that the disruption of long distance trade cut easy supplies of tin making bronze impossible to make older implements were recycled and then iron substitutes were used drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socio economic problems and led to wars more recently brian fagan has shown how the diversion of mid winter storms from the atlantic to north of the pyrenees and the alps bringing wetter conditions to central europe but drought to the eastern mediterranean was associated with the late bronze age collapse robert drews argues that massed infantry used newly developed weapons and armor ff cast rather than forged spearheads and long swords a revolutionizing cut and thrust weapon and javelins were used the appearance of bronze foundries suggest that mass production of bronze artifacts was suddenly important in the aegean for example homer uses spears as a virtual synonym for warrior suggesting the continued importance of the spear in combat such new weaponry used by a proto hoplite model of infantry able to withstand attacks of massed chariotry would destabilize states that were based upon the use of chariots by the ruling class this precipitated an abrupt social collapse as raiders and or infantry mercenaries began to conquer loot and burn the cities a general systems collapse has been put forward as an explanation for the reversals in culture this theory raises the question of whether this collapse was the cause of or the effect of the bronze age collapse being discussed in the middle east a variety of factors including population growth soil degradation drought cast bronze weapon and iron production technologies could have combined to push the relative price of weaponry compared to arable land to a level unsustainable for traditional warrior aristocracies in complex societies which were increasingly fragile this combination of factors may have contributed to the collapse the critical flaws of the late bronze age are its centralization specialization complexity and top heavy political structure these flaws then revealed themselves through revolts defections demographic crises overpopulation and wars between states other factors which could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include the aggression of the sea peoples the effect of pirates on maritime trade drought crop failures and famine", " the children of llullaillaco were mummies of children who were found in argentina it appears that they had been

lived over a period of years long before the bronze age and farmed crops like wheat lentils and peas they also kept cows and dogs and sometimes hunted in the forests around them for other animals like deer their diet probably didn t contain enough energy for them as they often did not grow as tall as the people who came before them or as people do now this might have also been because of disease which can spread more easily in a village than it can when people are moving about a lot and not seeing many other people as people did before the neolithic people in the lbk culture probably died quite young in their twenties or thirties and many of their children would die before they grew up if a person was very sick and in a lot of pain the lbk people might have had access to opium which did not make them better but took away the pain they probably knew how to make some illnesses better by using wild herbs as medicine the lbk people probably worshiped a mother goddess who represented the fertility of the land they farmed because this was before the bronze or iron ages there were no metal tools and everything the lbk people had was made from either stone wood and plants such as flax which could be made into clothing and things that could be got from animals like leather or fur they even had sickles which are used for cutting down grass and are half moon shaped blades with a handle coming off one end however theirs were made of wood with sharp stone points glued into them for the cutting the lbk people lives in rectangular longhouses and digging up an area often shows

probably the world s oldest known boat carbon dating shows that the boat was made during the early mesolithic period between bce and bce right now the canoe is in the drents museum in assen netherlands the boat is a dugout style canoe measuring centimetres in long and centimetres in wide it was made from a single log of scots pine wood scratches are found on the walls of the canoe these were probably made by flint or antler tools the boat was found in during the creation of the dutch a motorway the motorway is south of the village of pesse in hoogeveen to make the base of the motorway the peat was removed during this construction a crane operator found what he believed to be a tree trunk metres ft in underground local farmer hendrik wanders saw the log and took it for observation he gave the canoe to the university of groningen where it was examined and freeze dried to stop decay it was later taken to the drents museum near the discovery site many have wondered if the pesse canoe was actually a boat some danish historians questioned if a boat so small could sail in a similar canoe was constructed by archaeologist jaap beuker and successfully paddled by a canoeist others thought that the canoe could be something else believing it was used as an animal feeder beuker argued that animals were not kept by the people from the era the boat was made so it

called new archaeology is a way of doing archaeology that tries to be as scientific as possible archaeologists are people who study people through objects often by digging for remains and artifacts processual archaeologists use specific methods to come up with general rules that explain human culture around the world and through time this means they are trying to find reasons that explain why people around the world do things in similar ways processual archaeology came about in the s and is an approach to archaeology this means it is a way of doing archaeology that people choose to follow before the processual approach another approach was culture history which tried to only create histories for particular places culture history archaeologists started with a modern culture and traced its roots back as far as they would go culture history archaeologists dug units square holes that are dug very carefully that went very deep to find the oldest objects anywhere you dig the youngest materials are close to the surface at the top and the oldest materials are at the bottom archaeologists learn about the history of a place by knowing what objects came in what order this helps archaeologists understand the history of a place processual archaeology is different from culture history because archaeologists dug larger units to understand more widely what was happening at a site or place of archaeological importance these new archaeologists also added many scientific instruments to help them study the past lewis binford was a famous processual archaeologist from the s he believed that archaeology should be practiced like anthropology anthropology is the study of past and present people and the many parts of what it means to be human binford argued that archaeologists are responsible to add to anthropology as a field of study this includes how cultures and societies around the world change over time binford wanted to study different types of things to show changes over time in many different parts of human culture he tried to do this by studying things in a systematic way a way that follows set rules and can be repeated binford believed that some parts of culture were more important than others and thought that the way people act is based on forces or laws that people do not know about and cannot control processual archaeologists tried to create models to explain why and how people would act they felt that humans behave the same and given the same conditions or choices people will make similar ones processual archaeologists also decided to conduct archaeologically scientifically they used radiometric dating techniques to figure out how old an artifact is as well as other techniques to prove how the artifact was used they began to reproduce artifacts to better understand how they were made this is called experimental archaeology another scientific approach was to conduct ethnographic fieldwork link to better understand past hunter gatherers processualists think that the way hunter gatherers are today is similar to the way they were in the past this helps us understand them better post processualism challenged processual archaeology post processual archaeologists thought that processualists did not think beyond the artifacts and forgot about the people behind the pots they also challenged the assumption that humans act rationally and the idea that behavior can be modelled they also challenged how processual archaeologists know what they know and looked at the biases behind work processual archaeology continues to be used today however it is not the same as it was when it started the biggest change came with computers the models that archaeologists could be tested and seen to be accurate or not more detailed examinations of artifacts could be made not all archaeologists think the same way about the past after processual archaeology came post processual archaeology which challenged a lot of the assumptions

works of art it is now used in a wide range of fields including archaeology paleontology archives manuscripts printed books and science and computing the main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery this has a special value to help authenticate objects to prove what they are provenance is essentially a matter of documentation in archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to provenance archaeological researchers use provenience to refer to the three dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site whereas provenance covers an object s complete documented history ideally in modern excavations the provenience or find spot is recorded even videoed with great precision but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded an object may have both a provenience where it was found and a provenance where it has been since it was found in some cases especially where there is an inscription the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground as well as its history after rediscovery", " radiocarbon dating also known as the c dating method is a way of telling how old an object is it is a type of radiometric dating the method uses the radioactive isotope carbon most organic matter contains carbon carbon has different isotopes which are usually not radioactive c is the radioactive one its half life time it takes to reduce its radioactivity by half is about years this makes it possible to tell the age of substances that contain carbon the method works to about years old dates obtained are usually written as before present present is plants take up atmospheric carbon dioxide by photosynthesis and are eaten by animals so every living thing is constantly exchanging carbon with its environment as long as it lives once it dies however this exchange stops in hessel de vries showed that the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere varies with time and locality the relatively short lived c is constantly renewed by cosmic ray bombardment on atmospheric nitrogen since the bombardment is slightly variable and for other reasons the c taken into organic matter is also slightly variable that leads to errors in the chronology however under about years the results can be compared with dendrochronology based on tree rings for the most accurate work variations are compensated by means of calibration curves the method was developed by willard libby and his colleagues at the university of chicago in in he was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for this work he first demonstrated the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by accurately estimating the age of wood from an ancient egyptian royal barge of which the age was known from historical documents", " red lady of

skeleton was first thought to be that of a woman william buckland who found it thought that it must have been that of a witch or a prosititute during the roman era britain in radiocarbo dating was done and the skeleton was found to be about years old the man had been bout at the time of his death the age of years was problematic though it meant that the british isles would have been settled

the former lake texcoco in central mexico archaeologist helmut de terra discovered it in february the skeleton was dated to a time before columbus discovered america the pre columbian era the skeleton is that of a woman it was found near mammoth remains it is at least years old it was fancifully hailed by time magazine as the oldest mexican soldier the skeleton was found lying face down with the arms under the chest and the legs drawn up to the stomach the body most likely sunk into the mud surrounding it leaving the shoulder back and hips exposed which might explain why those elements are missing it is possible that the body was originally put in the lake the deposits of the area where the skeleton was found dated the site where tepexpan man was found to about to years ago near the skeleton there were the remains of five mammoths they could be associated with obsidian flakes therefore it was originally believed that tepexpan man dated to about years ago however years later researchers looked at the skeleton again and dated the remains using radiocarbon methods it was then found to be closer to years old dr silvia gonzalez a professor of geoarchaeology at john moore university in liverpool used uranium isotope analysis to date the skeleton results showed that tepexpan man was years old she argues that contamination of the remains led to the wrong radiocarbon dates other critics have claimed that tepexpan man was an intrusion in that he was buried at a later date but dug into pleistocene materials an analysis of tepexpan man that was published in the issue of the science newsletter claims that the individual was at least at the time of death this was determined by united seams in the skull referring to sutures and fused epiphyses in long bones in his first report helmut de terra claims that the other bones in conjunction with the skull indicate that the person was of male sex based on dna analysis a mexican archaeologist has proposed that tepexpan man was actually a woman tepexpan man has a healed fracture on his right ulna de terra thought that due to this fracture and the proximity to mammoth fossils tepexpan man may have been a hunter who was either killed by his fellow men or mortally wounded while hunting the science newsletter claims that the individual suffered from a stiff neck due to the many limy deposits on the cervical vertebrae this means that tepexpan man most likely suffered from arthritis the science newsletter described tepexpan man in its edition it described tepexpan man as having a high domed thin walled skull which contained a brain the same size as those of present day indians the writers described a solidly built jawline and prominent brow ridges as well as a sharply prominent chin which would separate him from earlier neanderthals tepexpan man only had three teeth left in his upper jaw in his lower jaw all of the molars had disappeared before his death this was evidenced by the alveolar sockets being healed and smoothed over in the mandible what was left on the mandible included incisors eye teeth and premolars that were worn but still in decent condition dr gonzalez also reconstructed the environment of lake texcoco around the time of tepexpan man by analyzing sediments and fossils from the area with her team she analyzed sand clay and volcanic ash as well as fossils of diatoms microscopic algae and ostracods ostracods are small crustaceans when tepexpan man was alive the lake was very deep full of fish and surrounded by trees the environment surrounding lake texcoco changed a lot over the past years there were several volcanic eruptions water levels and several types of vegetation also changed these environmental changes clearly affected populations living in the area today lake texcoco has almost dried up it is on the northeast outskirts of mexico city ams radiocarbon dates of the sediments at tepexpan show ages between and c years bp new uranium series date the skeleton to years bp which would indicate a holocene age the evidence suggests that there were large changes around lake texcoco in terms of the balance between water and land

soldiers are the same some carry weapons such as daggers bows and arrows swords spears or axes the terracotta army figures were made in workshops the head arms legs and torsos were created separately and then assembled studies show that eight face moulds were most likely used and then clay was added to provide individual facial features once put together features such as facial expressions were added it is thought their legs were made the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were made at the time this would make it an assembly line production with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it in those times each workshop had to write its name on items produced once they were completed the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty ", " the tollund man is the name for a mummy which was found in denmark in the s the man lived in the th century bc in what is known as the pre roman iron age the head and face were so well preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim twelve years before the discovery of tollund man another bog body elling woman was discovered in the same bog below the body was a thin layer of moss scientists know that this moss was formed in danish peat bogs in the early iron age therefore the body was suspected to have been placed in the bog more than years ago during the early iron age c radiocarbon dating was performed it indicated that he died in approximately bc the acid in the peat along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface had preserved the delicate soft tissues of his body examinations and x rays showed that the man s head was undamaged and his heart lungs and liver were well preserved the silkeborg museum estimated that he must have been approximately years old and about m ft in tall at the time of his death this means he was relatively small even for the time it is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog on the first autopsy report in doctors concluded that tollund man died by hanging rather than strangulation the rope left visible marks in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck there was no mark however at the back of the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located after a re examination in forensic scientists found more evidence to support these findings although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged as they often are in hanging victims radiography showed that the tongue was distended an indication of death by hanging the stomach and intestines were examined and tests carried out on their contents the scientists discovered that the man s last meal had been a kind of porridge made from vegetables and seeds both cultivated and wild barley linseed gold of pleasure camelina sativa knotweed bristlegrass and chamomile there were no traces of meat in the man s digestive system and from the stage of digestion it was apparent that the man had lived for to hours after this last meal in other words he may not have eaten for up to a day before his death although similar vegetable soups were not unusual for people of this time two interesting things were noted bog bodies dry up and decompose rapidly when they are taken out of the bog because of the facial expression and the general state of the head the decision was taken to expose the body at the time the head was preserved using polyethylene glycol the only material available this method did not permit to preserve the body it dried up and decayed today the head is attached to a copy of the body both feet and the right thumb were also in a good state of preservation when the body was found in the s for this reason they were kept in formaldehyde for analysis later in the danish police force made a finger print analysis making tollund man s thumb print one of the oldest finger prints on record tollund man is exposed in the

age at death has been estimated from years six months to as old as years the most recent scientific review suggests years of age it was first thought that he would have grown to m tall but recently a height of m was proposed research showed that his growth differed from that of modern humans he would have had a shorter and smaller adolescent growth spurt the skeleton was discovered in by kamoya kimeu a member of a team led by richard leakey at nariokotome near lake turkana in northwest kenya the shape of the pelvis identifies that the specimen was a male his estimated age at death depends upon whether the maturity stage of his teeth or skeletal is used and whether that maturity is compared to that of modern humans or chimpanzees a key factor here is that while modern humans have a marked adolescent growth spurt chimpanzees do not while initial research assumed a modern human type of growth more recent evidence from other fossils suggests this was less present in early homo this affects the estimation of both his age and his likely stature as a fully grown adult the pelvis is narrower than in homo sapiens which might indicate more efficient running whether to run down small game or to avoid predators the boy was relatively tall which would have increased his surface area and helped him to lose heat body hair may also have been thinner to hasten cooling body hair was lost in the shift towards savanna living in equatorial africa modern humans evolved this trait an estimated one million years ago the skeleton still had features such as a low sloping forehead strong brow ridges and the absence of a chin not seen in h sapiens the arms were slightly longer turkana boy had a projecting nose rather than the open flat nose seen in apes", " in archaeology a type site or

josef szombathy at a paleolithic site near willendorf willendorf is a village in lower austria near the city of krems the statuette is made of a kind of limestone that can not be found in the area it is colored with red ochre a study made in suggests that the figure was made between and bce very little is known about its origin how it was made or what it meant to the people who made it the venus is not a realistic portrait but rather an idealization of the female figure her vulva breasts and swollen belly are very pronounced this suggests a strong connection to fertility her tiny arms are folded over her breasts and she has no visible face her head is covered with what might be coils of braids eyes or a kind of headdress the lack of a face has prompted some archaeologists and philosophers to view the venus as a universal mother to add to this many scientists believe that the coils of the venus hair were meant to represent the cycles of a woman s period or ovulation the nickname urging a comparison of this rather obese figurine to the classical image of venus causes resistance in some modern analysis the ironic identification of these figurines as venus pleasantly satisfied certain assumptions at the time about the primitive about women and about taste christopher witcombe has noticed at the same time there is professional reluctance to identify her as an earth mother goddess of paleolithic old europe source some suggest that her corpulence would represent high status in a hunter gatherer society and that beside her obvious fertility she could be an emblem of security and success source the statue s feet do not allow it to stand on its own due to this it has been speculated that it was meant to be held rather than simply looked at catherine mccoid and leroy mcdermott think that the figurines were done as self portraits by the women themselves most scientists agree that the head seen from a profile view while having no distinct facial features appears to be looking down the common physical characteristics of all of the venus figures are a thin upper torso largely exaggerated breasts large buttocks and thighs a large stomach possibly due to pregnancy and oddly bent short legs that end with disproportionately small feet yet when looked upon as if you were a woman looking down at your body the physical features in perspective seem correct there are striking similarities between the venus of willendorf and a pregnant woman when perceived from above venus of willendorf is part of the collection of the naturhistorisches museum in vienna

thicker where there is land between to km or to mi thick under the seas they are sometimes only km or mi thick there are three groups of rocks that make up most of the earth s crust some rock is made when the hot liquid rock comes from inside the earth igneous rocks another type of rock is made when sediment is laid down usually under the sea sedimentary rocks and a third kind of rock is made when the other two are changed by very high temperature or pressure metamorphic rocks a very few rocks also fall out of the sky meteorites below the crust is warm and almost liquid rock that is always moving around the earth s mantle then there is a thin liquid layer of heated rock the outer core this is very hot c or f or k the middle of the inside of the earth would be liquid as well but all the weight of the rock above it pushes it back into being solid this solid middle part the inner core is almost all iron this is what makes the earth magnetic the earth s crust is solid but made of parts which move very slowly the thin level of hard rock on the outside of the earth rests on hot liquid material below it in the deeper mantle this liquid material moves because it gets heat from the hot center of the earth the slow movement of the plates is what causes earthquakes volcanoes and large groups of mountains on the earth there are three ways plates can come together two plates can move towards each other convergent plate edges this can form islands such as japan volcanoes and high mountain ranges such as the andes and himalayas two plates can move away from each other divergent plate edges this gives the warm liquid rock inside the earth a place to come out this makes special mountain ranges below the sea or large low lands like africa s great rift valley plates are able to move beside each other as well transform plate edges such as the san andreas fault this makes their edges crush against each other and makes many shocks as they move the outside of the earth is not even there are high places called mountains and high flat places called plateaus there are low places called valleys and canyons for the most part moving air and water from the sky and seas damages rocks in high places and breaks them into small pieces the air and water then move these pieces to lower places because of this the earth would have been very flat a long time before now the fundamental cause of the differences in the earth s surface is plate tectonics the shape of the entire planet itself is not even a ball because of its velocity earth has a slight bulge at the equator other than that earth is shaped more like a pear than an actual sphere all places on earth are made of or are on top of rocks the outside of the earth is usually not uncovered rock over of the earth is covered by seas full of salty water this salty water makes up about of all earth s water the fresh water people can drink is mostly ice only a very small amount is in rivers and under the earth for people to drink and use the air above the earth stops the water from going away into outer space also much of the land on earth is covered with plants or with what is left from earlier living things places with very little rain are dry wastes called deserts deserts usually have few living things but life is able to grow very quickly when these wastes have rainfall places with large amounts of rain may be large woods lately people have changed the environment of the earth a great deal all around the earth is a large amount of air the atmosphere the mass of the earth pulls the gasses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space the air is mostly made of nitrogen about and oxygen about but there are a few other gasses as well most living things need the air or parts of the air gripped in the water to breathe and live they use the gasses especially oxygen and carbon dioxide to make and use sugar and to give themselves power the air animals and plants use to live is only the first level of the air around the earth the troposphere the day to day changes in this level of air are named weather the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the climate rain and storms are both in this level both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up cold air becomes thicker and falls and warm air becomes thinner and goes up the turning earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the earth generally gets more power from the sun and is warmer than the north and south points at the same time air over water specially very warm water gets water in it but because cold air is not able to take in as much water it starts to make clouds and rain as it gets colder the way water moves around in a circle like this is called the water cycle above this first level there are four other levels the air gets colder as it goes up in the first level in the second level the stratosphere the air gets warmer as it goes up this level has a special kind of oxygen called ozone the ozone in this air keeps living things safe from damaging rays from the sun the power from these rays is what makes this level warmer and warmer the middle level the mesosphere gets colder and colder with height the fourth level the thermosphere gets warmer and warmer and the last level the exosphere is almost outer space and has very little air at all it reaches about half the way to the moon the three outer levels have a lot of electric power moving through them this is called the ionosphere and is important for radio and other electric waves in the air it is also where the northern lights are even though air seems very light the weight of all of the air above the outside of the earth air pressure is important generally from sea level to the top of the outer level of the air a space of air one cm across has a mass of about kg and a space of air one sq in across has a weight of about lb the mass of the air also keeps the earth safe when rocks meteorites hit it from outer space without the air the damage meteorites do would be much greater because of the air meteorites generally burn up long before they get to the earth the air also keeps the earth warm specially the half turned away from the sun some gasses especially methane and carbon dioxide work like a blanket to keep things warm in the past the earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now since people have grown used to the heat we have now though we do not want the earth to be too much warmer or colder most of the ways people create electric power use burning kinds of carbon especially coal oil and natural gas burning these creates new carbon dioxide and can cause more warming a large discussion is going on now about what people should do about the earth s latest warming which has gone on for about years so far this warming has been good for people source plants have grown better and the weather has been better than when it was colder before some people who learn about science though say that many bad things will possibly come about if the warming goes on about seven billion people live on earth they live in about different lands called countries some for example russia are large with many large cities others for example vatican city are small the five countries with the most people are china india the united states indonesia and brazil about of people live in the north half of the world which has most of the land scientists think that people originally came from africa now of all people do not live in africa but in europe and asia people change the earth in many ways they have been able to grow plants for food and clothes for about ten thousand years when there was enough food they were able to build towns and cities near these places men and women were able to change rivers bring water to farms and stop floods rising water from coming over their land people found useful animals and bred them so they were easier to keep ", " when talking about geography the elevation of a certain point is how high it is compared to some reference point very often the reference point is mean sea level the level of the ocean midway between high and low tide on an average day most land has a positive elevation which means it is above sea level a few desert places are below sea level thus have negative elevation sometimes elevation is measured against the center of the earth the problem there is that the earth does not really look like a ball it is slightly squashed an oblate spheroid this means that while still at mean sea level at the equator some points are farther away from the center of the earth than others that way the peak of chimborazo a volcano in ecuador is farther away from the center of the earth than the peak of mount everest yet mount everest is higher above sea level ", " before the aswan dam was built there was a nile flood once a year this flood carried rich

visible in aswan starting in june and reaching its peak in august the water reaches the eastuary of the nile about two weeks later the flooding always occurs at the same time in some years it may be a few days erlier in others it will be a few days later what cannot be prediced is the total amount of water little water meant droughts and famine too much water would cause damage to dams and houses",

country for example after the kingdom of england and the kingdom of scotland joined together in they formed the united kingdom when ireland joined in the unified country became the united kingdom of great britain and ireland a second reason is a country splitting apart to form new ones for example after czechoslovakia split in it became two new countries the czech republic and slovakia also after ireland gained independence from britain the region of northern ireland stayed in the uk therefore the country s name changed from united kingdom of great britain and ireland to what it is today the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland a third reason could be a new government replacing or overthrowing the old one after the communist party took overthrew the russian empire s emperor the tsar and changed the country s name to the soviet union the city of saint petersburg also changed to leningrad this was because the communist party wanted to honor its leader vladimir lenin and symbolize the soviet union s turning away from russia s system of absolute monarchy the tsardom that ruled before they did since saint petersburg was named after peter the great who was the tsar that founded the city when the city of new amsterdam founded by dutch colonists in north america was lost to the british empire it was renamed new york city after the duke of york a fourth reason could be changing a place s name to replace a name given by former colonizers with the name given by native people and many more for example after india gained independence from britain they changed the name of the city bombay to mumbai a fifth reason could be the change of standard spelling rules in the local language when pinyin was made the official romanization or writing mandarin chinese using the roman alphabet in mainland china after the chinese communist party took over the spellings of many chinese place names changed including peking becoming beijing and nanking becoming nanjing even though the pronunciations of chinese place names in mandarin chinese were not any different before the changing of spelling the older spellings did not accurately show their pronunciation therefore the pronunciation of chinese place names in other languages or their exonyms were based on their spelling rather than the mandarin pronunciation which is why they sound so different from each other in order to teach people how to correctly pronounce mandarin chinese the ccp made hanyu pinyin the only accepted romanization in mainland china even though taiwan also speaks mandarin the spellings of taiwanese place names including taipei and kaohsiung is according to the older spelling rules for chinese place names this is because many taiwanese do not want to use hanyu pinyin even though it is the standard romanization of mandarin chinese worldwide because it was created by the communist party of china", " geopolitics is the study of how a country s geography location terrain

research done by a variety of applied psychologists and educators the learning material is in a kind of textbook or teaching machine or computer the medium presents the material in a logical and tested sequence the text is in small steps or larger chunks after each step learners are given a question to test their comprehension then immediately the correct answer is shown this means the learner at all stages makes responses and is given immediate knowledge of results it is rather interesting that edward l thorndike wrote in if by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible and so on much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print thorndike however did nothing with his idea the first such system was devised by sidney l pressey in the first teaching machine was developed by sidney l pressey while originally developed as a self scoring machine it demonstrated its ability to actually teach in world war ii with largely conscript armies there was great emphasis on training what was learnt influenced education and training after the war one of the main methods was the use of movies as a group training method research on the effectiveness of training films was done extensively in one account lumsdaine comments that research on films went on from about to the present meaning a few conclusions stood out from the research one was that films were great at giving overviews of a situation or an operation however they were less successful at getting over the details some general features of film and later television stand out one is that a film goes at its own pace another is that no specific responses or activities are required from the viewer a third is that the audience is varied sometimes hugely varied this gives clues to ways of improving instructional films in a experiment at yale university questions for students were put between segments of a film on the heart and circulation with correct answers given after students had responded knowledge of results this added significantly to the amount learnt from the film lumsdaine commented that even showing the basic film twice was not so effective as showing the version with questions and answers the connections between this experiment and those of pressey were obvious active responses by learners and helpful feedback on the activities were now seen as critical elements in any successful system of learning pressey s work had been half forgotten but it was now recognised as significant if so much research had already been done on learning from films what exactly did programmed learning add the short answer is stimulus control by which is broadly meant the teaching material itself also in programmed learning a complete system was proposed which included these stages a helpful discussion of the different programming techniques was given by klaus although there were three or four other systems proposed we discuss here the two best known methods one was by norman crowder a psychologist with the u s air force he had been asked to investigate the training of aircraft maintenance men crowder s system was to set multiple choice questions in the text and provide feedback for each of the alternatives examples of this method show that the alternatives offered in questions were chosen to cover mistakes which students were likely to make much better known was the other style of programmed learning as proposed by the behaviourist b f skinner skinner made some very effective criticisms of traditional teaching methods his scheme of programmed instruction was to present the material as part of a schedule of reinforcement in typical behaviourist manner the programmed text of skinner s theory of behaviorism is the most complete example of his ideas in action skinner was a wonderful publicist for his own ideas as can be seen from this passage both methods were originally presented in machines and both were later presented in book form both systems were to an extent student centered they were ways of teaching individual learners who worked at their own pace both systems in different ways used knowledge of results to promote learning p in both systems the content was pre tested to identify problems and iron them out both systems emphasised clear

english group the following year that same student might be reassigned to a new set of groups school tracking is a reality functioning under an assumed identity called ability grouping besides tracking another way to deal with diversity is to integrate students of different ability levels together in small working groups cooperative learning gives students a sense of pride for both their

other famous persons after bc they began writing more organized histories written history appeared first with the ancient greeks whose historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology the very first historical works were the histories composed by herodotus of halicarnassus bc ca bc who became later known as the father of history cicero thucydides was the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event and his successor xenophon ca bc introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his anabasis the romans adopted the greek tradition becoming the first people to write history in a non greek language the most famous writers are julius caesar s bc bc bellum gallicum livy bc ad who records the rise of rome from city state

writing often took the form of annals or chronicles recording events year by year but this style tended to hampered the analysis of events and causes an example of this type of writing are anglo saxon

about states or nations during the renaissance the study of history changed during the enlightenment and romanticism voltaire described the history of certain ages that were important according to him

become more scientific by demanding more mathematical evidence in history in order to make the history discipline less subjective furthermore he added a social economic and geographic framework to answer historical questions other french historians like philippe ari s and michel foucault described history of daily life topics such as death and sexuality they wanted history to be written about all topics and that all questions should be asked historical journals for academic historians to exchange ideas started in the nineteenth century the early journals were similar to the academic journals used in the physical sciences and were seen as a means by which history could be professionalised journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches the most notable example of which was annales conomies soci t s civilisations a publication instrumental in establishing the annales school the question of how a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important questions within historiography it is commonly recognised by historians that in themselves individual historical facts are not particularly meaningful such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach some of the more common historigraphical approaches are determinism means that historians view history as being caused more by certain factors than by other factors the two most common types of determinism are geographic determinism and economic determinism geographic determinism means that historians think history is mostly caused by geography frederick jackson turner was a proponent of geographic determinism economic determinism

book first published in zagreb in the book was written by a croatian roman catholic priest dr viktor novak who was also a professor at belgrade and zagreb universities and the member of the yugoslav academy science and arts in this book novak wrote about roman catholic clericalism in croatia from the beginning of the th century to the end of world war ii the vatican curia placed the book on their list of banned books the index librorum prohibitorum and said that novak was an enemy of the catholic church novak wrote that he spent more than years collecting documents and books to write his book he started collecting this material during his secondary school days continued it as a university student and as a member of the austrian institute of history in vienna austria then as a university professor in zagreb and belgrade he worked on three books of which magnum crimen is the last the first two parts of are the magnum tempus and the magnum sacerdos in after the destruction and occupation of the kingdom of yugoslavia novak was forced to destroy all material he had collected he was in danger of being arrested and killed by the german occupying forces and their collaborators in belgrade he was among the first ten people arrested in belgrade by germans but managed to survive and continue work on this book after liberation of belgrade in october novak dedicates this book to the victims known and unknown as well of the clero fascism observing the roman catholic church activities in yugoslavia for more than fifty years the author concludes that this church replaced the idea of service to god by service to the roman curia i e service to the government of the roman pontificate in the role of the world leader as a result of this idea in the kingdom of yugoslavia the roman catholic church identified the roman catholicism to the croatian nationhood which turned most of its priesthood into ardent ustashe supporters the book describes activities of the roman catholic clergy in the kingdom of yugoslavia including their intention and attempts to become above the state to control the state and eventually everyday lives of the common people it has two distinct parts the first part consists of fifteen chapters covering the roman catholic clericalism from the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century in austria hungary then in the kingdom of yugoslavia the second part the last four chapters covers the rise and fall of the independent state of croatia and the active support of the roman catholic church clergy the main doctrine of the roman catholic church in the kingdom of yugoslavia was that a the clergy shall be paid by the state as the state officials b the state cannot have any control over the church c the church has right to be fully involved in the political life of the kingdom of yugoslavia d the church doctrine religious education shall be a part of primary and secondary school curricula and that e the roman catholic church curricula in the schools shall be obligatory to all pupils whose at least one parent is a roman catholic to achieve these goals the church supported clerical political parties confronting them to other confessions primarily to the serbian orthodox church by publicly preaching hatred against the orthodox population and advocating croatian and slovene separatism and intolerance against others josip juraj strossmayer s ideas of which the most important one was serving god equals to serving people created close relations between croats and serbs by introducing the old slavonic language as the liturgy language of the roman catholic church in the balkans were aggressively suppressed by the roman catholic clergy in croatia and slovenia the clergy put the roman curia in between the god and the people demanding from the roman catholics ultimate obedience to the roman curia and unconditional love of the roman pope the clergy remaining faithful to the strossmayer was marginalized with the most ardent supporters excommunicated by the zagreb archbishop nevertheless strossmayer was embraced as a great roman catholic bishop by the same clergy but his teaching was distorted or not mentioned ever the same destiny faced franjo ra ki ante trumbi and stjepan radi three croatian politicians advocating actively and fighting for the yugoslavism as a common denominator of togetherness and life among the slavic people of the kingdom of yugoslavia the trumbi and radi s struggle against centralism was interpreted as the croatian and slovene separatism support novak demonstrated that even the anti croatian activities in the italian croatian and slovene lands as compensation for their aid in world war i were not counteracted by the croatian and slovene roman catholic clergy in yugoslavia expulsion of the croatian and slovene clergy from these lands and their replacement by the italians was received with silence and accepted without resistance or protest among their catholic brethren in yugoslavia ante paveli s political activities in the kingdom of yugoslavia the ustashe terrorism and the embracement of fascism were all supported by the roman catholic clergy paveli s nationalism identified roman catholicism to the croatdom which was actively supported and interpreted by the clergy the second part of this book is about the beginning of the independent state of croatia the active support of the roman catholic clergy to this state and their involvement and support in the extermination and or forceful conversion of the serbs and extermination of the jews and the roma people the book is full of testimonies and documents showing the active involvements of the catholic clergy in supporting organizing and executing extermination of serbs jews and roma people of the kingdom of yugoslavia one of the most bizarre events described was that roman catholic priests in the jasenovac concentration camp working every day on the most gruesome ways to kill the camp inmates while they went to chapel regularly each day to pray to god at the end of world war ii the catholic clergy defended themselves claiming their opposition to forceful conversion and extermination in some letters and instructions directed to the priesthood the book notes that these letters and directions were not public and not respected or followed in fact an article from novi list argued that a jew could not be save by converting to the roman catholicism archbishop aloysius stepinac is portrayed in this book as an ardent roman catholic crusader who publicly endorsed the establishment of the independent state of croatia acknowledged the ustashe as croatian patriots defended her before the roman pope and was responsible for the racist attitude and behavior of his clergy this edition except

sokol organizations were later established in croatia slovenia serbia bulgaria poland and russia the sokol movement had full support from strossmayer then bishop of akovo after the dissolution of austria hungary and the establishment of the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes in and under the leadership of lazar car croatian sokol societies were united with serbian and slovenian sokol clubs into a large sokol alliance on june the separatism prone croatian clergy forced croatian sokols to leave the yugoslav sokol alliance in fueling internal conflicts within the alliance on political grounds at the same time high catholic clergy established the orlovi eagles clerical organization with the aim of taking youths away from the alliance the croatian catholic church rejected the pan slavic idea of bringing together catholic orthodox and muslim believers under the motto that a brother is dear regardless of his faith the two catholic organizations orlovi eagles and katoli ka akcija catholic action were a main base of this resistance to the idea of yugoslavism brotherhood and religious tolerance the catholic church s resistance to this idea of pan slavism led the polish sokols to abstain from the international all sokol rally held in prague in chapter xv titled libellus accusations is about a few croatian clergymen who were followers of strossmayer s idea namely that to serve people means to serve god the most prominent among them was frano ivani evi a national fighter and promoter of old slavonic church language as the language of liturgy in the croatian catholic church

there were many sources of slaves prisoners captured in war kidnapping people selling their children and criminals were some of the more common sources the market price for slaves would go down after a battle in which many slaves were taken slavery was a large part of the greek economy a slave could earn money and could earn enough to purchase their freedom ancient rome was even more dependent on slaves slavery was also a part of medieval europe societies that did not depend on slaves were often the source of slaves in the viking world slavery was an important part of the economy not only the taking of slaves in raids and battles but also selling slaves in other markets the vikings were slave traders they captured used and sold slaves most forms of slavery declined in northern europe but was practiced elsewhere in europe in sicily italy spain france russia and north africa slavery lasted through much of the middle ages most of these slaves were white and came from other parts of europe and eastern europe as the new world was colonized slavery was a well established source of cheap labor by the time columbus came to the americas europeans had already been using african slaves in their colonies in west africa historians estimate that between ad and the s to million people were enslaved by the arab world they were taken from europe asia and africa across the red sea indian ocean and the sahara desert for four centuries beginning in the late th century millions of africans were taken as slaves by europeans they got this idea from the arab empires which had been taking black slaves from africa since the th century europeans began exporting africans to the new world as a source of cheap labor on colonial plantations this was called the atlantic slave trade early attempts to enslave native americans failed which gave rise to the african slave trade africans were a relatively easy source of slaves as european traders did not have to capture them but relied on arabs and other africans to do it for them even before outside slave traders took advantage of africans the africans themselves had established slave trading theirs was not an economy based on money but on trading slaves were a commodity a substitute for money slaves were often sold at markets and auctions slave auctions show that slaves were not thought of as human beings with human rights instead they were thought of as property which could be bought or sold slaves that were for sale were often advertised in the newspapers like today s newspapers advertise cars or houses slave traders were even listed in public directories like today s phone books p slaves did not have any say in what happened to them many times families were split up and sold to different owners for different amounts of money millions of families became separated this way and never saw each other again there were three types of auctions grab and go may the highest bidder win and the scramble in a grab and go auction a buyer would give the slave trader a certain amount of money and would get a ticket when a drum roll sounded the pen holding the slaves would open the buyer would rush in and grab the slave or slaves that he wanted he would then show his ticket to the slave trader before he left in a may the highest bidder win auction slaves would be shown to the buyers one at a time if more than one buyer wanted a particular slave all of the buyers would have to bid on the slave making offers for what they were willing to pay slaves would be investigated by the buyer and would be forced to be poked and tortured by the buyer the buyer who bid the highest would be able to buy that slave for the amount of money he bid in the scramble buyers would quickly grab whichever slaves they wanted and would take them to work slaves were prepared for this when the sellers put fat and tar on them to make them look more healthy", " the space age is the time period in human history related to the space

concentrates on the th century a period when human history was arlready globally connected osterhammel carefully avoids telling a story of the th century instead in the beginning he looks at carefully selected aspects the image that people had of themselves at that time their understandig of time and space looking at self image and iunderstanding of time he always sees the th century in terms of its characteristic differences from the earlier centuries and the changes that brought about the structures of the th century the sentence before the th century not a single year can be seen as epochal for all mankind p can be considered exemplary the th century is placed in the continuity of the previous centuries and on the other hand clearly differentiated from the degree of globalization of the th this also applies to his statements about space he carefully takes care that common terms are not used unchecked as they were in the th century the collective name southeast asia was created in japan during the first world war p the category the west for example cannot be found as a dominant figure of thought before the s p in the long nineteenth century there was much more talk of the civilized world than of the west in japan it was even the goal of national politics to be accepted as a civilized country p osterhammel then gives an overview of eight major realities under the heading panoramas without claim to completeness which are intended to capture essential elements of the overall history of the th century sedentary and mobile living standards cities frontiers empires and nation states power systems wars internationalisms revolutions state energy and industry work and employment nets hierarchies knowledge civilization and exclusion religion osterhammel describes five special features of the th century osterhammel does not tell from a certain perspective but looks at the connections the non simultaneity of the simultaneous the diversity of cultures and the time shift of institutions and cultural elements in different cultures from different perspectives he justifies this courageous approach as follows in retrospect the th century can be thought of being globally because it thought so about itself patrick manning in sum i find the book to be an effective overview of the world history literature as it now exists the author has demonstrated the ability to draw comprehensively on the literature for many topics and regions for his long nineteenth century and has articulated it in accounts of many large scale issues the book presents a multifaceted narrative of approaches panoramas and themes it reaches back before to trace the origins of the nineteenth century world but puts more effort into showing consequences for the twentieth century j r mcneill in he published this work in german and it won acclaim and vaulted osterhammel to the front rank of historians when chancellor angela merkel celebrated her sixtieth birthday in the festivities even featured a lecture by osterhammel osterhammel like the field of world history as a whole has underemphasized social history leaving readers with a view of the past that exaggerates elite initiatives as the source of change the relative brevity of osterhammel s discussions on africa and latin america as compared with europe north america and asia reflects world historical bias in favor of initiative from the centers of power and fits with the strengths of the published literature patrick manning", " toreirol lambuba meitei is an ancient veritable account puya of toponyms and

for common patterns that one can find across all cultures universal historians use a thematic approach that means they look at history from two viewpoints on the one hand they look at processes of world history that have drawn people of the world together on the other hand they want to find out how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience the study of universal or global history is in some ways a product of the current period of accelerated globalization this period has two tendencies it integrates various cultures and it shows their differences when people of different cultures and civilizations have to live with each other to discuss the history of the world in a unified framework is not that new for example it was a genre popular in the th century and

to the lord the lord used his army of soldiers from all of his vassals to protect those vassals the lord also gave him the piece of land that he held as a fief by analogy the term vassal is used also for similar systems in other feudal societies the development of the vassal in a society that was increasingly organised around the concept of lordship in french the seigneur is one sign that antiquity ended and the early middle ages began lordship is the basic social institution as tacitus described them in his book germania the roman west experienced them for the first time in the migration period as the system developed in the seventh century the vassals were gangs of freemen who subjected themselves in some degree of formality to the authority of a leader from whom they could expect to be fed clothed and armed the quality of a vassal was only in his fighting ability and the strength of his loyalty the etymology where the word came from of vassal is from a celtic word gwas

history is the study of what the entire human race did in the past as recorded this includes the time from prehistory to the present day it excludes natural history modern human beings called homo sapiens wise man have lived for about years the first homo sapiens lived at the same time as other species of human these included homo erectus standing man and homo neanderthalensis man from neanderthal they were a little bit different from modern humans the theory of human evolution says that modern humans neanderthals and homo erectus slowly developed from other earlier species of human like creatures biologists believe that homo sapiens evolved in africa and spread from there to all other parts of the world replacing homo neanderthalensis in europe and homo erectus in asia homo neanderthalensis generally called neanderthal man was discovered when the cranium of a skull was found in the neanderthal valley in it was different from a modern human skull so scientists believed it was from a new species entire neanderthal skeletons have been found in other places since then neanderthals existed before modern humans and knew how to use tools and fire when ancient stone tools are found their style often shows whether they were made by homo sapiens or neanderthals see palaeolithic by the end of the stone age it is believed that homo sapiens were the only type of humans left climate is different from one part of the world to another some areas are hot all year and some are cold some areas are dry all year and others are wet most areas have climates that are warm or hot in the summer and cool or cold in the winter most parts of the world get rain at some times of the year and not others some parts of the world have oceanic climates and others have alpine climates these differences cause people to live differently climate affects what food can grow in a certain place this affects what food people eat if one food is easier to grow it often becomes a staple food staples foods are foods that people eat more of than other foods staple foods are usually grains or vegetables because they are easy to grow wheat maize millet rice oats rye potatoes yams breadfruit and beans are examples of different staple foods from around the world climate also affects the types of animals that can live in any area which affect the types of meats that are available to eat climate also affects the buildings that people make the clothes that they wear and the way that they travel the climate on earth has not stayed the same through human history there are long periods of time when it is generally warmer and there are long periods of time when it is generally colder when it is generally colder there is more ice on the poles of the planet a cold period is called an ice age there have been many ice ages in the history of the earth two have affected humans from to around years ago there was a big ice age which affected humans and the way that they lived between ad and ad there was a period called the little ice age when the climate was a little bit colder than usual the word prehistory means before history it is used for the long period of time before humans began to write about their lives this time is divided into two main ages the paleolithic age or early stone age and the neolithic age or late stone age the two ages did not start and end at the same time everywhere a place moved from one age to another depending on when people changed their technology the end of prehistory also varies from one place to another it depends on the date when written documents of a civilization can be found in egypt the first written documents date from around bc in australia the first written records date from and in new guinea from about in the paleolithic era there were many different human species according to current research only the modern human homo sapiens reached the neolithic era the paleolithic era is by far the longest age of humanity s time about of human history the paleolithic age started about million years ago and ended around bc the age began when hominids early humans started to use stones as tools for bashing cutting and scraping the age ended when humans began to plant crops and have other types of agriculture in some areas such as western europe the way that people lived was affected by the ice age in these places people moved towards agriculture quicker than in warmer places where there was always lots of food to gather their culture is sometimes called the mesolithic era middle stone age during the paleolithic era humans grouped together in small bands they lived by gathering plants and hunting wild animals this way of living is called a hunter gatherer society people hunted small burrowing animals like rabbits as well as birds and herds of animals like deer and cattle they also gathered plants to eat including grains grain often grows on grasslands where herds of grass eating animals are found people also gathered root vegetables green vegetables beans fruit seeds berries nuts eggs insects and small reptiles many paleolithic bands were nomadic they moved from place to place as the weather changed they followed herds of animals that they hunted from their winter feeding places to their summer feeding places if there was a drought flood or some other disaster the herds and the people might haved moved a long distance looking for food during the ice age a lot of the water on earth turned to ice this made sea much lower than it is now people were able to walk through beringia from siberia to alaska bands of homo sapiens another word for people travelled to that area from asia at that time there were rich grasslands with many large animals that are now extinct it is believed that many groups of people travelled there over a long time and later spread to other parts of america as the weather changed paleolithic people used stone tools sometimes a stone tool was just a rock it might have been useful for smashing a shell or an animal s skull or for grinding grain on another rock other tools were made by breaking rocks to make a sharp edge the next development in stone tool making was to chip all the edges of a rock so that it made a pointed shape useful for a spearhead or arrow tip some stone tools are carefully flaked at the edges to make them sharp and symmetrically shaped paleolithic people also used tools of wood and bone they probably also used leather and vegetable fibers but these have not lasted from that time paleolithic people also knew how to make fire which they used for warmth and cooking a simple stone tool from the sahara region a carefully made spear head from france small female figures such as the venus of willendorf years old are the earliest sculptures of the human figure a horse from lascaux caves in france about years old some cave paintings are years old the neolithic era was marked by changes in society during the neolithic era people started to settle down they developed agriculture and domesticated animals both of which took a very long time because of these two things people did not have to migrate as much any more villages could grow to much larger sizes than before over time villages fought and spread their control over larger areas and some became civilisations during this time humankind also developed further intellectually militarily and spiritually when humans started to grow crops and domesticate certain animals such as dogs goats sheep and cattle their societies changed because people now grew crops and raised livestock they started to stay in the same place and build permanent settlements in most places this happened between and years ago their diet also changed people ate more cereals and vegetables they started to keep extra foods and seeds for later in some years there were surpluses extras that could be traded for other goods these changes happened independently in many parts of the world they did not happen in the same order though for example the earliest farming societies in the near east did not use pottery no one is sure if britain had agriculture or if permanent villages existed there at all early japanese societies used pottery before developing agriculture in the paleolithic era there were many different human species according to current research only the modern human reached the neolithic era vere gordon childe gave the name neolithic revolution to this process in the s he thought that it was as important as the industrial revolution which happened in the th and th century ancient history was the time from the development of writing to the fall of the roman empire the fall of the roman empire caused chaos in europe leading to the middle ages also called the dark ages or the age of faith sumer was the world s first known ancient civilization the sumerians took over the fertile crescent region of mesopotamia around bce by bce many cities had been built in parts of sumerian mesopotamia they formed independently and each had their own government they were called city states and often fought with each other sumer grew crops on the tigris and euphrates rivers a surplus in food led to a division of labour this means that some people were able to stop growing crops and do other jobs since enough crops were already grown this brought a split in society today such a split is called social pyramid in a social pyramid people are grouped into social classes based on their wealth and power in sumer the king priests and government officials were at the top of the social pyramid below them were the artisans merchants farmers and fishers at the bottom of the pyramid were slaves slaves were often prisoners of war criminals or people working to pay off debt in sumer only the sons of the rich and powerful learned how to read and write they went to a school called edubba only the boys who went to edubba could become scribes the sumerians created the world s first system of writing it was called cuneiform the oldest versions of one of the world s first literary works the epic of gilgamesh go back to this time they also invented sun dried bricks the wheel the ox plow and were skilled at making pottery they are also thought to have invented the sailboat other civilizations around this time were also built along major river systems these civilizations are called river valley civilizations river valley civilizations were the most powerful civilizations in this time period because water was needed to have an agricultural society these civilizations were similar to sumer in that in the river system of mesopotamia after the sumers two other great civilizations rose to power the babylonians with their king hammurabi famous for the codex hammurabi and the assyrians just to the east was the long lasting civilization of elam ancient egypt grew along the nile river and was its most powerful in the second millennium bc when it was its biggest it went all the way from the nile delta to a mountain called jebel barkal in sudan it was created around bc and probably ended at about bc when the country was invaded by the roman empire the society of ancient egypt depended on a balance of natural and human resources especially the irrigation of the nile valley so that egyptians could grow crops they are also known for writing in hieroglyphs building the famous pyramids other sorts of tombs and big temples and for their military there was a great difference between classes in this society most of the people were farmers but they did not own the agricultural products they produced these were property of the state temple or noble family that owned the land there was slavery but it is not clear how it was practiced the rulers of ancient egypt tried to keep their people happy by religion that made them respect the rulers and their past the religion of judaism formed about bce in context with the egyptian and babylonian civilization the first dynasty of ancient china the shang dynasty has been carbon dated through turtle shells with writing on them to back to about bc they say china began as city states in the yellow river valley at the end of the zhou dynasty lived the greatest chinese philosophers kong fuzi founder of confucianism and laozi founder of daoism the qin emperor qin shi huang in bc created the first centralized state in china based on his political philosophy of legalism and made everyone write the same way he fought against confucianism he also started a precursor of the great wall in bc the han dynasty took over and developed an empire of similar strength as the roman empire and towards the end of its rule influenced by india introduced buddhism in china the indus valley civilization started from about bc to bc it marked the beginning of the urban civilization on the subcontinent it was centered on the indus river and its tributaries the civilization is famous for its cities that were built of brick had a road side drainage system and multi storied houses during the maurya dynasty started in bce most of the indian subcontinent was united under a single government for the first time ashoka the great who in the beginning sought to expand his kingdom then followed a policy of ahimsa non violence after converting to buddhism the edicts of ashoka are the oldest preserved historical documents of india and under ashoka buddhist ideals spread across the whole of east asia and south east asia the gupta dynasty ruled from around to ad the gupta empire included only central india and the area east of current day bangladesh however this empire never included present day pakistan to the west gupta society was ordered in accordance with hindu beliefs historians place the gupta dynasty alongside with the han dynasty tang dynasty and roman empire as a model of a classical civilization the maya civilization is a civilization that started in central america they lived mostly on the yucat n peninsula in what is now known as mexico but also honduras belize and guatemala they were the only known civilization of pre columbian america to have a fully developed written language they also made great achievements in art and architecture and had a very advanced system of mathematics and astronomy the area where the maya civilization developed was inhabited from around the th millennium bc the first maya settlements were built there in about bc in the soconusco region this is in the modern day state of chiapas in mexico on the pacific ocean today this is called the early preclassic period at the time humans began to settle down permanently they started to grow livestock pottery and small clay figures were made they constructed simple burial mounds later they developed these mounds into step pyramids there were other civilizations around especially in the north such as the olmec the mixe zoque and zapotec civilizations these people mostly lived in the area of the modern day state oaxaca the exact borders of the maya empire in the north are unclear there were probably areas where maya culture overlapped with other cultures many of the earliest significant inscriptions and buildings appeared in this overlapping zone these cultures and the maya probably influenced one another there has been a long history of contact between papuan peoples of the papua new guinea and the aboriginal people aboriginal people seem to have lived a long time in the same environment as the now extinct australian megafauna stories about that are told in the oral culture of many aboriginal groups the hallstatt era is named after the city hallstatt in austria where the first artifacts were found it lasted from about bc to about bc there were different periods which today are mainly told apart by the kinds of brooches used at the time these brooches changed rather rapidly and can therefore give us good guesses at to what time they came from hallstatt culture sites have been found in the east of france in switzerland in the south of germany in austria in slovenia and croatia northwestern hungary southwestern slovakia and southern moravia the culture can be divided into an eastern and a western one quite easily the dividing line runs through the czech republic and austria between longitudes and degrees east in this time the social structure developed into a hierarchy this can be documented by various things that were added to graves in the bronze age people used to live in big settlements as iron became available trade routes changed a new richer class evolved unlike before these richer class people liked to live in big houses in the countryside as a demonstration of their wealth funerals also changed from cremation burials to burials with stone coffins the new upper class used their wealth for import goods mostly from the mediterranean the la t ne culture is a culture that lasted from about bc to about ad it is named after the city of la t ne today marin epagnier next to neuch tel it was influenced a lot by the roman and greek cultures there are two sources for this the celts basically lived in clans each clan was headed by a leader which came from the druids or the bards women were much better off than with the romans they were almost equal to men there was polygamy and polyandry a man could have several women a woman could have several men illyria is the part of west south balkan peninsula populated by illyrians whose descendants are albanians illyrians lived in tribunes such as epirus dardania taulantia etc they had their own language the illyrian language that was different from the greek language and latin at the year bc the population of illyria is estimated to be around what is known today as ancient greece is a very important period in history most people agree that it came after the minoan and mycenaean civilizations it ended when the romans invaded greece in bc greek culture had a very powerful influence on later civilizations especially the romans the greeks developed what is now called a city state or a polis there were many polises some of the more important ones were athens sparta corinth and thebes the word politics comes from there it literally means things that are about the polis greek cities did not have much contact with each other because of the mountains and many islands greece is made up of when a city no longer had enough food to care for all its citizens some people were sent out to set up a new city this was called a colony each city was independent and ruled by someone within that city colonies also looked to the city where they originally came from for guidance when greece went to war for example against the persian empire there was an alliance of such city states against the persians there were also many wars between different city states there were many artists and philosophers who lived in that period most of them are still important for philosophy today a well known artist was homer he wrote epics about the war against the trojans and the early history of greece other well known artists were aristophanes and sappho well known philosophers include socrates plato and aristotle a well known mathematician of the time was euclid statesmen of the time were pericles and alexander the great ancient rome was a civilization that started in modern day italy in the th century before christ the civilization lasted for centuries it ended when mehmed ii conquered constantinople on may according to legend the roman civilization was founded by romulus and remus in the year bc the roman empire developed in wars against carthage and the seleucid empire julius caesar conquered gaul modern france and augustus ended the roman republic by becoming emperor at its biggest extent the empire covered all of the mediterranean rome became so big because it led war against other nations and then assimilated their culture in diocletian organized a separate administration of the western and the eastern part of the empire the capital of the western part was rome the capital of the eastern part was constantinople constantine i was the first to stop discrimination against christians christianity became state religion under the reign of theodosius i the western part of the empire had many problems with barbarians in the th century the huns migrated westwards this meant that the visigoths moved into the empire to seek protection rome was sacked by barbarians multiple times on september the germanic chief odoacer forced the last roman emperor in the west romulus augustus to quit after about years the rule of rome in the west came to an end the eastern part had similar problems justinian i managed to conquer parts of north africa and italy shortly after he died all that was left were parts of southern italy and sicily in the east the empire was threatened by the sassanid empire after the fall of western rome the germanic tribes that took over tried to learn from roman civilization but much was forgotten and up to the renaissance not many achievements happened in europe but with the rise of islam many changes happened during the islamic golden age the greek and roman traditions were kept and further development took place the chinese civilization had a golden age during the tang period when their capital was the biggest in the world during the renaissance europe developed and made great advancements in many areas as well in arabia muhammad founded islam in his followers rapidly conquered territories in syria and egypt they soon were a danger to the byzantine empire in the th and th centuries the byzantine empire stopped islamic expansion and reconquered some lost territories in a d the eastern empire was at its height basileios ii reconquered bulgaria and armenia culture and trade flourished in the battle of manzikert led the empire into a dramatic decline for the byzantine empire this meant centuries of civil wars and turkic invasions the muslim caliphate had an golden age under the abbasids their power forced emperor alexius i comnenus of the byzantine empire to send a call for help to the west in the west sent the crusades these eventually led to the sack of constantinople in the fourth crusade in because of this what was left of the empire broke into successor states the winner of these disputes was that of nicaea after constantinople was again conquered by imperial forces the empire was little more than a greek state on the aegean coast the eastern empire came to an end when mehmed ii conquered constantinople on may the ottoman empire took its place and from to was the most powerful empire in the middle east and ruled at the southern and eastern coast of the mediterranean sea the tang dynasty with its capital at chang an today xi an was the biggest city in the world at the time and is considered by historians as a high point in chinese civilization as well as a golden age of cosmopolitan culture the ming dynasty ruled from to the ming built a vast army and navy from around the th th century in south india chola kings ruled tamil nadu and chera kings ruled kerala they had trading relationships with the roman empire to the west and southeast asia to the east in north india rajputs ruled in many kingdoms in two brothers named harihara i and bukka founded the vijayanagara empire in an area which is now in the karnataka state of india the most famous king of this empire was krishnadevaraya in rulers of this empire were defeated in a battle but the empire continued for about the next one hundred years northern india was ruled by islamic sultans the heian period in japan is famous for its art poetry and literature the writing system kana was developed it was followed by the feudal period during which samurai and daimyos were the leading figures and the shogun the real monarch whereas the tenn had only a role as religious head between the years and the mongols tried to invade but were driven out by the japanese in a portuguese ship reached japan japanese learned about guns and firearms from them genghis khan in brought together the mongol tribes and founded the mongol empire one of the largest land empires in history later kublai khan would go on to expand the empire and found the mongol ruled yuan dynasty of china the empire later broke into several empires all of which were later destroyed the middle ages was the time from the fall of the roman empire until the middle of the th century from to about there was some decline compared with the roman civilization european villages were often destroyed and looted by barbarians such as the vikings during the high middle ages magnificent castles and large churches called cathedrals were built and important works of literature were written in the later middle ages there was a plague called the black death the black death killed one third to one half of europe s population a system called feudalism was a very important part of the middle ages in this system the king was at the top of the social pyramid the king gave land to the lord in exchange for loyalty the lords were the next in the pyramid the lords gave land called a fief to knights in exchange for loyalty and protection the knights came next in the pyramid peasants were not part of the feudal system because they did not give or receive land they worked on a lord s manor in exchange for protection the crusades were also fought during the middle ages there is a theory that says the crusades helped end the middle ages along with the black death increased trade and better farming technology the renaissance started in italy renaissance is a french word meaning rebirth the renaissance meant that people learned from the ancient greek and roman or classical cultures that had been forgotten for some time artists learned from classical paintings and sculptures so they reinvented perspective and the art of free standing realistic sculptures that had been characteristic in greek and roman art some famous renaissance artists are leonardo da vinci michelangelo and raphael the gutenberg printing press invented by johannes gutenberg was also developed during this time the renaissance was also a time of great achievements in science galileo galilei francis bacon philosophy thomas more and literature dante alighieri william shakespeare what is known as the classical period lasted from about to about during this time many monuments were constructed there are also many big inscriptions from then in this period the maya moved to building large cities this is known as urbanism many important intellectual and artistic developments happened in an area that is known as the southern lowlands like the ancient greek the maya civilization was made of many independent city states agriculture was important around these city states like tikal and cop n the most important monuments are the pyramids they built in their religious centers and the palaces of their rulers the palace at cancu n is the largest in the maya area there are no pyramids in the area of the palace other important things the archaeologists found include the carved stone slabs usually called stelae the maya called them tetun or tree stones these slabs show rulers along with hieroglyphic texts describing their genealogy military victories and other accomplishments in north america they made mississipian culture with the largest land field from around ce to the maya also had trade routes that ran over long distances they traded with many of the other mesoamerican cultures such as teotihuacan the zapotec and other groups in central and gulf coast mexico they also traded with non mesoamerican groups that were farther away archaeologists have found gold from panama in the sacred cenote of chichen itza important trade goods were cacao salt sea shells jade and obsidian in the th and th century the cities in the southern lowlands had problems and declined at the same time the maya stopped making big monuments and inscriptions shortly afterwards these cities were abandoned currently archaeologists are not sure why this happened there are different theories either ecological factors played a role in this or the cause of this abandonment was not related to

countries and people they also borrowed many words from the languages of the people they took over an example of this is the word jungle which is a hindi word that has been adopted into english

also dialects of a certain language can sometimes be mutually unintelligible chinese for example has hundreds of different dialects and many native speakers of those dialects cannot understand each other without knowing the other s dialect for example the local dialects of beijing shanghai and hong kong are mandarin shanghainese wu chinese and cantonese yue in that same order if natives from each of these cities were to talk to each other in their native dialects they would not understand each other this is because they are too different from each other this is why the governments of china and taiwan want their citizens to speak standard mandarin in public so that there can be a spoken dialect of chinese everyone can understand while the spoken dialects are mutually unintelligible they all use the same written code chinese characters so they can understand each other if they write to each other these examples above show that the difference between language and dialect is often hard to define even for linguists or people who study languages as their job when a speaker of one language can understand what a speaker of another language is saying but not the other way around it

about punctuation capitalization and diacritics e g accents in english spelling is a problem for all learners and is the main issue in orthography some languages have someone to decide the correct spelling such as the acad mie fran aise english does not english orthography was the work of the early printers they had to decide how particular words would be spelled in their books gradually the number of alternative spellings began to drop the word which is merry today was spelled in about ways in written sources from the th to the th century p english orthography or english spelling is the way the letters of the alphabet are used to write down the ipa sounds of english the first manuscripts in old english were written using the latin alphabet it had letters p no alphabet fits its language exactly one reason for this is that there are always more sounds than letters in english there are far more vowel sounds than vowels the ancient greeks who were the first to use letters for vowels decided to use only a few letters for their vowel sounds this choice influenced all later alphabets english would need about vowels to represent the vowel phonemes sounds in common use p and some languages do have more letters for vowels the georgian language has a total of letters a shorter alphabet works by using two or three letters for a single sound or one letter for several sounds the english alphabet has only three consonants which have one sound cannot be produced by other combinations and are never silent n r and v the english language uses to consonant phonemes the other reason that alphabets never exactly fit languages is dialect a spoken language varies from place to place and from time to time this is very obvious with english as the pronunciation is so different in different parts of the world a written language will always be less flexible than its spoken parent it has a different function and is produced mechanically it must serve everyone who speaks the language and it does this by keeping the spelling similar from one time to another therefore all alphabets have sounds which are difficult to represent with the letters in use and english also has other problems sounds that can be written in different ways and spelling which can be pronounced in different ways this all gives rise to problems of spelling differences between american english and british english spelling came about mainly as the result of one man noah webster wrote a grammar a spelling book and finally an american dictionary of the english language in the course of this he proposed a number of simplifications in spelling in his dictionary he chose s over c in words like defense he changed the re to er in words like center he dropped one of the ls in traveler at first he kept the u in words like colour or favour but dropped it in later editions he also changed tongue to tung that did not stick his main reason was to help children learn to read and write webster s dictionary contained seventy thousand words of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before webster did create a slightly different identity for american english but because his efforts did not address some of the most glaring problems his variations make little difference to the way the language is used an example of the real problems in english orthography is the word ending ough which is pronounced several different ways tough bough cough the root causes of spelling variation are historical loan words come with their own foreign spelling some french loan words are still spelled in the french way others have been changed english spelling reform has been proposed by many people since webster such as george bernard shaw who proposed a new phonetic alphabet for english in some cases webster s changes have been widely adopted in britain the spelling programme came from the french us program is clearly simpler and more consistent with word endings in english in our modern world english orthography is still a problem in some countries notably france a national committee can give advice and direction as to spelling english has long escaped from national custody modern british spelling and use was greatly influenced by the two great english dictionaries samuel johnson s a dictionary of the english language and james murray s oxford english dictionary johnson s dictionary was hugely influential abroad as well as at home the dictionary was exported to america for american lexicographers the dictionary was impossible to ignore some people argue which language is the easiest to spell people who learn a second language tend to think that their first native language is the easiest however for the learner programmatic languages with well defined rules are easier to start with than english the spelling of the english language is by far the most irregular of all alphabetic spellings and thus the most difficult to learn english is in its origin a germanic language from its early roots as anglo saxon it has borrowed words from many other languages french a romance language and latin are the most frequent donors to english languages that use phonetic spelling are easier to learn to spell than others with phonetic spelling the words are spelled as they are pronounced the italian word orologio for instance is pronounced oh ro lo jo gi always making a j sound in english one comes across the word knife in knife the k is not spoken even though in english it s more common to pronounce k s when they are in words one of the problems we have is that similar sounding words may be spelt quite differently rough and ruff meet and meat great and grate words with complicated spelling may be pronounced simply leicester is pronounced lester even what rules we do have are frequently broken i before e except after c has over exceptions p almost all these problems have come about for historical reasons english has been changing for the last thousand years and as the language changes so parts of it get stuck with different spellings here are some of the causes of english orthography english has a huge number of words but its spelling comes from many different sources the large and varied lexicon of english has been bought at the expense of an increasingly deversified graphology p some languages have a high correspondence between phonemes and letters that means they get close to one letter for each sound if there was a perfect correspondence that language would have phonemic orthography english is highly non phonemic it has almost every kind of deviation known this field of study is called orthographic depth the orthographic depth of an alphabetic script is the degree to which a written language deviates from simple one to one letter phoneme correspondence it shows how easy it is to predict the pronunciation of a word from its spelling shallow orthographies are easy to pronounce based on the written word and deep orthographies are difficult to pronounce based on how they are written in shallow orthographies the spelling sound correspondence is direct given the rules of pronunciation one is able to say the word correctly most other international languages have similar problems in french arabic or hebrew new readers have difficulty learning to decode words as a result children learn to read more

are discovered not invented they exist in all cultures according to martin luther the reformer i shall never be a heretic i may err in dispute but i do not wish to decide anything finally on the other hand i am not bound by the opinions of men this means that if truth is not absolute it is not truth at all interestingly enough aristotle states that the high minded man must care more for the truth than for what people think so if we consider ourselves to be wise individuals our concern should be to find the truth not to submit to opinions in two national surveys conducted by barna research one among adults and one among teenagers people were asked if they believe that there are moral absolutes that are unchanging or that moral truth is relative to the circumstances by a to margin vs adults said truth is always relative to the person and their situation the perspective was even more lopsided among teenagers of whom said moral truth depends on the circumstances and only of whom said moral truth is absolute quite different are empirical truths all the findings of science are empirical they are based on evidence and might be wrong or incomplete also we can be wrong about what we think we

philosophers ask the question what is an action or what makes somebody do an action here are two theories some philosophers say that an action is caused by a person wanting something and thinking that by doing that action they can get it for example if i want an apple and think that by walking to a table with some apples on it i can get one then i will walk to the table it is important to have both a want desire and a thought about how to get it belief if i think that by walking to a table with some apples on it i can get an apple but want an orange and not an apple then i will not walk to the table if i want an apple but think that the table across the room is just a picture of a table then i will not walk to the table other philosophers say that the want think theory is not true they say that it is my brain and my nerves that causes an action they see the brain as working like a computer that directs small electric packages from some nerves to other nerves and stores some for a while

aesthetics one theory in aesthetics is called subjectivism subjectivism says that each person has their own sense of beauty so the only way of judging something s beauty is if people say it is beautiful a common way of describing this is beauty is in the eye of the beholder subjectivism also says for the same reason that something is art simply because someone says it is art this is backed

is the feeling of being left out not belonging or not understanding yourself in relation to your environment alienation can be talked about in many ways in psychology researchers talk about alienation

sociology alienation is a more complex and difficult idea alienation is how people understand themselves in relation to their entire society a good example of this is how people think of themselves when they are working and doing a job karl marx wrote about this this kind of alienation happens when people do work that they are not interested in or find boring however in almost all societies some people may have to do jobs that they don t like because they need to earn money this can be seen as a type of alienation because a person s true feelings and their actions are separated and unrelated on the other hand a person might feel empowered and connected if they do a job that they do like empowerment and the feeling of being connected is the opposite of alienation alienation is also a key

wrote a famous book on geometry called the elements many sophists were active including protagoras they are known mostly from what socrates said against them pythagoras may have been a mystic or a

went there to talk about ideas however it became a crime to philosophize some people were accused but socrates was the only one who was killed in bce see trial of socrates in his defense speech presented by plato he says it s because others were jealous he is considered the founder of political philosophy many of his conversations end without a conclusion so he is known for the socratic method socrates taught that no one wants what is bad and so if anyone does something bad it must be unintentional out of ignorance he concludes that all virtue is knowledge he often talks about his

generation after socrates he wrote thirty six dialogues and thirteen letters to socrates though some may be fake plato s dialogues have socrates along with xenophon plato is the primary source of information about socrates life socrates was known for irony and not often giving own opinions plato wrote the republic the laws and the statesman the republic says there will not be justice in cities unless they are ruled by philosopher kings those who enforcing the laws should treat their women children and property in common and the individual should tell noble lies to promote the common good

says that there are non physical abstract ideas that have the highest form and most real kind of reality aristotle moved to athens in bc and began to study philosophy he studied at plato s academy he left athens twenty years later to study botany and zoology he became a teacher of alexander the great and returned to athens ten years later to create his own school the lyceum at least twenty nine of his books have survived known as the corpus aristotelicum he wrote about logic physics optics metaphysics ethics rhetoric politics poetry botany and zoology aristotle disagreed with his teacher plato he criticizes the governments in plato s republic and laws and refers to the theory of forms as empty words and poetic metaphors he cares more about empirical observation and practical concerns

god or a creator according to the argument the appearance of design in nature is evidence for the existence of god the argument is teleological because it assumes a purpose the word teleological comes from the ancient greek telos which means end or purpose teleology assumes there is purpose or direction in the works and processes of nature immanuel kant called this argument the physico theological proof most of the classic forms of this argument are linked to monotheism simply talking about a designer gives the following simple formulation a concise and whimsical teleological argument was offered by g k chesterton in so one elephant having a trunk was odd but all elephants having trunks looked like a plot socrates c b c he argued that the adaptation of human parts to one another such as the eyelids protecting the eyeballs could not have been due to chance and was a sign of wise planning in the universe plato c c b c posited a demiurge of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the cosmos in his work timaeus for him the demiurge lacked the supernatural ability to create ex nihilo or out of nothing the demiurge was able only to organize the ananke the ananke was the only other co existent element or presence in plato s cosmogony plato s teleological perspective is also built upon the analysis of a priori order and structure in the world that he had already presented in the republic aristotle c b c also developed the idea of a creator of the cosmos often referred to as the prime mover in his work metaphysics aristotle s views have very strong aspects of a teleological argument specifically that of a prime mover who so to speak looks ahead in setting the cosmos into motion indeed aristotle argued that all nature reflects inherent purposiveness and direction cicero c c b c also made one of the earliest known teleological arguments in de natura deorum on the nature of the gods cicero stated the divine power is to be found in a principle of reason that pervades the whole of nature he was writing from the cultural background of the roman religion in roman mythology the creator goddess gaia was borrowed from greek mythology the romans called her tellus or terra augustine of hippo a d presented a classic teleological perspective in his work city of god he describes the city of man and essentially posits that god s plan is to replace the city of man with the city of god at some as yet unknown point in the future whether this is to happen gradually or suddenly is not made clear in augustine s work he did not however make a formal argument for the existence of god rather god s existence is already presumed and augustine is giving a proposed view of god s teleology augustine s perspective follows from and is built upon the neo platonic views of his era which in turn have their original roots in plato s cosmogony the idea is that one can infer the existence of intelligent design by looking at an object the teleological argument says that because life is complex it must have been designed it is argued that this is non sequitur logic life or objects are described as orderly or ordered which shows that an intelligent designer has ordered them however in real life there are examples of systems that are non random or ordered simply because it is following natural physical processes for example diamonds or snowflakes the design claim is often challenged as an argument from ignorance since it is often unexplained or unsupported or explained by unscientific conjecture supporters of design assume that natural objects and man made objects have similar properties therefore both must be designed however different objects can have similar properties for different reasons such as stars and light bulbs proponents must therefore demonstrate that only design can cause orderly systems or the argument is invalid a designed organism would on the face of it be in contradiction to evolutionary theory most biologists support the idea of evolution by means of natural selection they therefore reject the first premise arguing that evolution is not only an alternative explanation for the complexity of life but a better explanation with more supporting evidence living organisms obey the same physical laws as inanimate objects a range of chemical reactions could take place forming other chemicals with complex properties and ways of interacting over very long periods of time self replicating structures could arise and later form dna this has in fact been demonstrated artificially via the avida program which can construct complex programs without being given any design similar programs have had similar results with building machines biologists therefore commonly view the design argument as an unimpressive argument for the existence of a god another argument states that even if the argument from design proved the existence of a powerful intelligent designer it would not prove that the designer is god voltaire observed in his trait de m taphysique from this sole argument i cannot conclude anything further than that it is probable that an intelligent and superior being has skillfully prepared and fashioned the matter i cannot conclude from that alone that this being has made matter out of nothing and that he is infinite in every sense david hume pointed out that the argument does not necessarily lead to the existence of one god in his dialogues concerning natural religion the character philo argued p amidst other counterarguments to the teleological argument why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing the world critics such as richard dawkins often argue that the teleological argument would in turn apply to the proposed designer arguing any designer must be at least as complex and purposeful as the designed object in dawkins words the ultimate a reference to hoyle s analogy to a windstorm sweeping through a junkyard and constructing a this they say would create the absurdity of an infinite series of designers whilst the universe can at first seem be purposeful and ordered it has been asserted that upon closer inspection its true function becomes questionable some scientists such as richard dawkins a high profile advocate of atheism reject the claim that the universe serves any actual function claiming that the universe merely mimics purpose for example predators appear perfectly designed to catch their prey whilst their prey seem equally well designed to evade them likewise apparent inconsistencies in the design of organisms have been brought to attention by critics of the teleological argument some use such arguments to point towards natural selection as a blind biological designer as opposed to god source proponents of teleology have argued against this objection on various grounds for example william a dembski says that such arguments are based upon presumptions about what a designer would or would not do and so constitute a theological rather than scientific claim not knowing the designer he continues they are in no position to say whether the designer proposed a faulty compromise among those design objectives dembski pp additionally the claim of an apparent inconsistency between the design of predators and prey ignores the balance of the ecosystem dembski counters in criticizing design critics tend to place premium on functionalities of individual organisms and see design as optimal to the degree that those individual functionalities are maximized but higher order designs of entire ecosystems might require lower order designs of individual organisms dembski p george h smith in his book atheism the case against god points out what he considers to be a fatal flaw in the argument from design consider the idea that nature itself is the product of design how could this be demonstrated nature as we have seen provides the basis of comparison by which we distinguish between designed objects and natural objects we are able to infer the presence of design only to the extent that the characteristics of an object differ from natural characteristics therefore to claim that nature as a whole was designed is to destroy the basis by which we differentiate between artifacts and natural objects evidences of design are those characteristics not found in nature so it is impossible to produce evidence of design within the context of nature itself only if we first step beyond nature and establish the existence of a supernatural designer can we conclude that nature is the result of conscious planning p", " the

least two philosophical meanings one is a capability of the mind to perceive things like movement and size the second is our natural sense for other humans and the community both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge most people are expected to share these things naturally even if they can not explain why it is quite possible for common sense to be wrong and science often explains things in quite a different way from common sense people lack any common sense intuition of the universe at subatomic distances or of speeds approaching that of light today it is well

gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for humans they believed that the world belonged equally to everyone and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society many of these thoughts were later absorbed into stoicism the first philosopher to outline these themes was antisthenes who had been a pupil of socrates in the late th century bce he was followed by diogenes of sinope who lived in a tub on the streets of athens took cynicism to its logical extremes and came to be seen as the archetypal cynic philosopher he was followed by crates of thebes who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of cynic poverty in athens cynicism spread with the rise of

familiar with some examples the denotation of this example is a red rose with a green stem the connotation is that it is a symbol of passion and love this is what the rose represents the denotation is a brown cross the connotation is a symbol of religion according to the media connotation however to be more specific this is a symbol of christianity the denotation is a representation of a cartoon heart the connotation is a symbol of love and affection not in the way of a rose but a symbol of true love  several parts of meaning may be called denotation that depends on the contrast being drawn in logic and semantics denotational always attracts the extension meaning in the pair but the other element genuinely varies see intension for some more discussion a denotation is the strict literal dictionary definition of a word devoid of any emotion attitude or colour denotation often links with symbolism as the denotation of a particular media text often represents something further a hidden

certain rules such as the ten commandments is evil a person or a group that does evil things may also be called evil a version of the problem of evil perhaps by epicurus goes as follows another argument goes arguments such as these are about the logical problem of evil they attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and so cannot all be correct a common response is that god can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good some philosophers accept that arguments such as god allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that god and evil are logically incompatible even a highly implausible instance of god s coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose in theology there is a question if there is a god why does god let evil happen some think that evil proves that there is not a god others think that god lets evil happen so that people can choose not to do evil philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism for logical positivism the issue with god is the lack of any independent method of verification in their view this makes the proposition god exists not true or false but meaningless a similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified the study of good and evil in philosophy is called ethics ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil it attempts to give all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good christians believe that at the second coming of christ god will put an end to evil and the works of the devil see the end of the book of revelation in movies or tv series evil

second event which is an effect the phrase cause and effect refers to this the relationship between the two events is known as causality the philosopher mario bunge said we do not rest content with finding facts but wish to know why they should occur rather than not as a general rule explanations move from what we know to what we do not know this is important because it explains why different kinds of people may need different explanations a child a lay person and an expert may need different explanations of the same thing since what is already familiar to them will differ the asking of questions depends on language and is peculiar to humans it starts very soon after a child learns how to speak a kind of game which young children play with adults is the why game every parent gets the experience of their child asking a never ending stream of why questions until at last the adult says well it just is there can be plenty of argument about whether or not an explanation is appropriate and if so whether it is correct if one asks why the sun gives out heat and light to say because it is daytime is not appropriate even if it might indeed be daytime the real answer was not known until the th century before then peoples like the ancient egyptians thought it was caused by a god aten different kinds of why questions need different kinds of explanations including these add something to human knowledge a personal question like why did you do that clearly asks for an explanation what that explanation might be depends on context it all depends on circumstance this type of question about motives only applies to the people concerned many kinds of explanations are made up of more than one type an explanation can be valid or invalid or a combination of both some explanations may appear reasonable but turn out to be misleading or wrong", " a fact is a statement that is real or true or a thing that can be shown to be real or true a fact is something that has really happened or is actually the case the usual test for a statement of fact is whether it can be seen to be true standard reference works are often used to check facts scientific facts are verified by careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means a fact is a statement what a person says about something that is true a fact can answer questions like what color is it or who made that an opinion is different from a fact but you can say facts about a person s opinion for example someone can ask a question like what is alice s opinion about the book you can answer this question with a fact for example alice said she likes the book then it is a fact that alice says she likes the book but maybe alice does not like the book so it not a fact that alice likes the book but it is a fact that alice says she likes the book it is sometimes hard to know if something a person said is a fact or is an opinion if you want to learn a fact is important to ask many different people the same question every person will have a different story but the parts of the story that are the same are possibly facts the parts of the story that are different are possibly opinions one very good way to learn a fact is if a person can help you see it for example if you ask do you have my book to answer this question a person can let you see your book then you can know it is a fact that this person has your book a scientific theory is knowledge of important facts about a natural thing the facts in a scientific theory always have evidence that shows that the fact is not false a person who understands the scientific method can test to see if the facts of a scientific theory are correct when statements have been tested and shown to be not false they are said to be true the facts of each scientific theory have usually been questioned and tested for a very long time by many people however the critical point is that an agreed method has been used to show that the statement is not false because of this we know that the knowledge of a scientific theory is fact and not opinion examples of scientific theories include the theory of relativity and the theory of evolution", " factoid is

action for example as good or bad it only makes sense if the action is freely chosen things like advice persuasion and prohibition are pointless unless people have some kind of free will free will means people can do different things different results come from different courses of action traditionally only actions that are freely willed deserve credit or blame if there is no free will there is no sense or justice in rewarding or punishing anybody for any action free will is a major problem in ethical philosophy and is also relevant to the philosophy of science in ordinary life and in law people are generally assumed to have free will and are responsible for what they do determinism comes from the idea that our world and the universe is in some way rather like a machine this idea goes back a long way in history at least years there is more than one kind of determinism but essentially it is the idea that events in the past fully decide cause events in the future it is the same as saying the universe is like a clockwork instrument if you knew everything about it you could predict exactly what will happen to illustrate this pierre simon laplace proposed a thought experiment in which he called laplace s demon if determinism is the case then there can be no free will the view that a deterministic universe means people do not have free will is called incompatibilism it means if determinism is true it is incompatible with free will and so free will does not exist many thinkers do not like what follows from hard determinism and ideas have been put forwards as to why we do have free will here we give just one of these ideas soft determinism or compatibilism tries keep determinism but still claims that free will is possible david hume had this position according to hume free will is not the ability to make a different decision under the same circumstances because there may be slight differences in the circumstances a different decision can be reached chrysippos a stoic philosopher gives the example of a dog which is tied to a cart this dog can freely decide to follow the cart william james coined the term soft determinism in the dilemma of determinism in there james writes a common opinion prevails that the juice has ages ago been pressed out of the free will controversy james went on to argue just as did plutarch that events fall into two groups the causally determined and the rest i myself believe that all the magnificent achievements of mathematical and physical science our doctrines of evolution of uniformity of law and the rest proceed from our indomitable desire to cast the world into a more rational shape in our minds than the shape into which it is thrown there by the crude order of our experience the world has shown itself to a great extent plastic to this demand of ours for rationality how much further it will show itself plastic no one can say if a certain formula for expressing the nature of the world violates my moral demand i shall feel as free to to throw it overboard or at least to doubt it as if it disappointed my demand of uniformity of sequence the principle of causality for example what is it but a postulate an empty name covering a demand that the sequence of events manifest a deeper kind of belonging of one thing with another than the mere arbitrary juxtaposition which now phenomenally appears the law assumes we have free will the job of courts is to find out when people do things and what they were thinking when they decided to do it for example think of someone who kills someone else a court tries to figure out if he or she actually killed the other person and if he or she decided to do it the courts do not ask the philosophical question above in the past people such as democritus saw the universe as deterministic some people thought that getting enough information would allow them to predict perfectly what will happen in the future modern science however is a mixture of deterministic and stochastic theories", " frugality is a quality of spending money very carefully and in limited amounts this decision can be made for various reasons some are to save money make costs smaller and get the most possible value from purchases some ways of attempting to be frugal could be to make less waste stop doing things such as travel or entertainment with high costs and having control over spending desires also being careful to get all the use out of an item before replacing it and not agreeing with customs that have high costs more ways could be using zero cost choices using barter trading without money and having a good knowledge of prices some people will use a discount store to find low cost things some will buy things used by other people in thrift stores garage sales flea markets or from classified advertising in a newspaper or on the internet from a site similar to craigslist frugality in some philosophies is when a person does not agree with experts who say they know what is good for everybody this is a special use of the word for philosophers many religions think frugality is important and good the quakers and puritans are two examples of christian religions that put high value on frugality the base of this idea is that people should store money to use when any person not only friends needs help environmentalists think that being frugal is good they think because ancient humans did not need many things and were able to get happiness from nature it is more natural to be frugal than to agree with the customs of modern living", " general semantics is a philosophy that deals with how people react to things that happen around them based on meaning it was created by alfred korzybski during the s and early s the goal of general semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something either mentally or in language that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified how people understand reality is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality general semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen heard felt or believed ", " german philosophy refers to

christian wolff leibniz thought that knowledge comes from reason alone on the wake of the enlightenment a new philosophy called critical philosophy developed in germany it combined the ideals of philosophers jean jacques rousseau of france and switzerland and david hume of scotland and rationalism and empiricism the founder of this school was immanuel kant he published three critiques the most revolutionary being critique of pure reason the other two being critique of practical reason and critique of judgement two followers of kant schelling and fichte thought that kant s system had some errors and sought to improve it a third philosopher hegel developed his own kind of german idealism his books are often difficult to read and his ideas influenced many people including those who

means of interaction are unknown or speculative ryle thought this was absurd and as a kind of error which he called a category mistake it is like saying something like cars move by motive spirit", " god is dead german gott ist tot help info is a well known phrase by the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche it is also known as the death of god the phrase is not meant literally instead it is about what value destruction has done to people s belief in christianity some religious thinkers do take it literally though nietzsche wrote this phrase in his book the gay science german die fr hliche wissenschaft it is in the section called the madman he also used the phrase in his book thus spoke zarathustra german also sprach zarathustra which is most responsible for making the phrase popular source the idea is written in the madman as follows god is dead god remains dead and we have killed him how shall we comfort ourselves the murderers of all murderers what was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives who will wipe this blood off us what water is there for us to clean ourselves what festivals of atonement what sacred games shall we have to invent is not the greatness of this deed too great for us must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it  god is dead god stays dead and we have killed him how will we comfort ourselves now that we are murderers more than all murderers the world s holiest and strongest thing ever has bled to death under our knives who will wipe this blood off us what water will we use to clean ourselves what festivals to make things right what holy games will we have to invent isn t the greatness of this action too great for us won t we have to become gods ourselves just to seem worthy of it god is dead does not mean that nietzsche believed in an actual god who had died literally nietzsche is also not saying that atheists are right instead the phrase means that everything built on christianity will fall apart because the belief in the christian god has become unbelievable this becomes a deep sadness because it includes all european morality as well for nietzsche the destruction of christian morality is not something to celebrate it is also not something to confidently replace with a non christian morality god is dead is an attack on anyone who thinks that a non christian morality can support the morals that people take for granted many philosophers still think this way and nietzsche says they are wrong he says it is impossible to have a christian or pseudo christian morality without the belief in god this was a problem he had with many modern sceptics the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy says that even though the basis of christianity was meant to have been unbreakable it is already broken in fact it has been much more able to die than anyone could ever understand this also means that without god morals are not unquestionable or undoubtable anymore nietzsche says that when these morals are shown to be false they are also shown to be harmful also trying to remove these harmful morals causes even more harm this is because people have become dependent on them he also says that the most harmful parts of morality have taken control of how we understand ourselves therefore we don t know how to live without this harmful morality because of this the death of god leads to many kinds of nihilism nietzsche says that christianity itself is a kind of nihilism when one gives up the christian faith one pulls the right to christian morality out from under one s feet this morality is by no means self evident christianity is a system a whole view of things thought out together by breaking one main concept out of it the faith in god one breaks the whole nothing necessary remains in one s hands  when you give up christian beliefs you completely remove your right to have christian morality this morality is not at all obviously true on its own christianity is a system it is a whole view of things thought out together when you remove the belief in god from it you make the whole thing fall apart you will not have anything left that it needs", " the god paradox is an idea in philosophy this idea is explained here this is a paradox because if either outcome were considered true then it is argued that god almighty is actually not almighty the god paradox is a good example of a philosophical problem this section has some answers to this paradox one answer is that god could make it so he can t lift the mountain by his own choice in other words god can lift the unliftable mountain because he is all powerful but he chooses not to be able to and so he chooses to cut his own power because he is able god can also choose to not be able to create such a mountain god is all powerful so he can choose not to have the power to make an unliftable mountain simply said god can cut his own power but in so doing he can still regain that power it is a limbo a state between not powerful and powerful something that is not definable by our knowledge of what is possible or impossible because god is almighty he surpasses our definitions of what he can and cannot do god this answer says god is able to do only things less than god if you say there exists a mountain that is heavier than anybody is able to lift then what you say is funny it means nothing because god is able to lift any mountain this is because saying a mountain is too heavy to lift means this mountain cannot be lifted by anybody this does not mean that god is too weak to lift very heavy mountains god cannot lift an unliftable mountain because that would not make sense he also cannot create an unliftable mountain because that also would not make sense if god can lift everything god could still lift any mountain that is not defined as cannot be lifted for example god can make a mountain as heavy as he wants but he cannot make a round square in logic problems can often be solved by breaking them into smaller pieces one solves each of the small problems let us see how one can use this for the god paradox the paradox is if one changes this question to a sentence it becomes we can make this even simpler first we must see that because god can do anything now we can write the sentence as these facts facts and must always be true now we must see if fact is true or false the conclusion is that the statement god can do anything needs to be qualified by this logic god cannot do both of two things that are mutually contradictory c s lewis says that logical contradictions are not a thing rather they are nonsense the question and therefore the perceived paradox is meaningless nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words god can before it some people think yes god is able to do things that make him not able they think god is able to do things that are funny to think because they say there is nothing god is not able to do see gospel of matthew however other bible verses mention things that god cannot do hebrews says that god cannot lie malachi says that god cannot change james says that god cannot be tempted by sin some have suggested that god can do things that defy conventional logic if he lives in other dimensions a different logic may apply some say that god cannot make a square circle this is true in a two dimensional world however a cylinder can be a square viewed from the side and a circle viewed from the top likewise a triangle can have three angles that add to more that degrees this is possible only on a three dimensional surface like a sphere it can t be done on a two dimensional plane plane geometry addition of an additional dimension changes the logic god is beyond limitation his strength is infinite if he chooses to create a mountain that is too heavy for him to lift he would simultaneously become strong enough to lift it which actually means he s not omnipotent because if he can gradually become stronger then he can t be all powerful to ask if the creation of such a mountain is possible is to attempt putting a limitation on the limitless at the end of the book of job god answered job out of the whirlwind and asks him who is this that darkens council by words without knowledge where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth job chapter in other words god s powers are beyond human understanding as human reason itself is part of god s creation in the book of genesis these references may not be simple to understand", " the golden rule is a moral which says treat others as you would like them to treat you this moral in various forms has been used as a basis for society in many cultures and civilizations it is called the golden rule because there is value in having this kind of respect and caring attitude for one another people of many religions see the value of this mandate and have similar expressions in christianity jesus christ taught this idea to his disciples and others when he gave his sermon on the mount it is recorded in the holy bible in the book of matthew chapter and verse jesus explained to his listeners that all the things that were recorded in the jewish law and that the prophets had taught about concerning morality was summed up in this one rule the context of this statement matthew is about god s mercy and kindness the principle that was shared is to not always treat others as they might deserve to be treated as we may judge some as undeserving but instead to always be merciful and charitable not withholding good in other religions and belief systems there is a similar concept of the ethic of reciprocity also called the golden rule they usually give a similar idea although sometimes it has been expressed in the form such as do not treat others as you would not like to be treated one of the earliest rules of this type is from the old testament days

" karma car ma is a word meaning the result of a person s actions as well as the actions themselves it is a term about the cycle of cause and effect according to the theory of karma what happens to a person happens because they caused it with their actions it is an important part of many religions such as hinduism and buddhism in shinto a religion often syncretised with buddhism karma is interpreted as musubi a view of karma is recognized in shinto as a means of enriching empowering and life affirming in terms of spiritual development karma is about all that a person has done is doing and will do karma is logically about punishment or reward it makes a person responsible for their own life and how they treat other people the theory of karma is a major belief in hinduism ayyavazhi sikhism buddhism and jainism all living creatures are responsible for their karma their actions and the effects of their actions karma is often misconstrued as the universal principle of cause and effect our actions both good and bad come back to us in the future helping us to learn from life s lessons and become better people in religions that include reincarnation karma extends through one s present life and all past and future lives as well karma is basically energy one person throws out energy through thoughts words and actions and it comes back in time through other people karma is the best teacher forcing people to face the consequences of their own actions and thus improve and refine their behavior or suffer if they do not even harsh karma when faced in wisdom can be the greatest spark for spiritual growth the conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and unemotional response supporting any action with the claim i am doing it is karma claiming doership of any action binds karma to support the action with the belief i am the doer is called binding the karma it is this support of the belief of doership that binds karma if you know that you are not the doer and are aware of who the true doer is i am not the doer and who is the doer then the action will not have any support and the karma will be shed the process of action and reaction on all levels physical mental and spiritual is karma one must pay attention to thoughts because thought can make karmas good bad and mixed i say kind words to you and you feel peaceful and happy i say harsh words to you and you become ruffled and upset the kindness and the harshness will return to me through others at a later time finally what i give is what i get back an architect thinks creative productive thoughts while drawing plans for a new building but were he to think destructive unproductive thoughts he would soon not be able to accomplish any kind of positive task even if he desired to do so hindus look at time as a circle as things cycle around again karma is a very just law which like gravity treats everyone the same the law of karma puts man at the center of responsibility for everything he does and everything that is done to him understanding the way karma works hindus try to live a virtuous life this is called dharma there are three types of karma in hinduism karma is considered one of the natural laws of the mind just as gravity is a law of matter just as god created gravity to bring order to the physical world he created karma as a divine system of justice that is self governing and infinitely fair it automatically creates the appropriate future experience in response to the current action several different views exist in hinduism regarding the role of divine beings in hinduism many see the deities or devas as playing some kind of role other hindus such as the mimamsakas reject such notions and see karma as acting independently considering the natural laws of causation sufficient to explain the effects of karma some interpretations of the bhagavad gita suggest an intermediate view that karma is a law of cause and effect yet god can mitigate karma for his devotees it is said in bhagavad gita that only the karma that is done with a sense of doership and with attachment to the karma could cause good or bad reactions karma that is done with an attitude of duty and without attachment to the results will not create any effect and will move one closer to god another view holds that a satguru acting on god s behalf can mitigate or work out some of the karma of the disciple", " liberty means the condition in which an individual has the ability to act following his or her own will and alternatively achieve their potential within the context of other words like

classical liberals think communism is against liberty because communism is most of the times against the individual basic rights life freedom and property classical liberalism conceptions of liberty conceive mainly of the freedom of the individual from outside compulsion in terms of freedom from restraint and social liberalist perspective on the other hand highlights the need for social and economic equality as in the power and resources to fulfill one s potential as such a social liberalist connects liberty i e freedom to the equal distribution of political power i e democracy in the sense of positive liberty they argue that liberty without equality means the domination of the most powerful thus freedom and democracy are seen as connected and ultimately antagonistic john stuart mill in his work on liberty was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as not being forced to do something mill also sought to define the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual and as such he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus the prevailing question becomes how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control there are mainly ten types of freedom they are", " meaning is a term in linguistics

question there are also artists who paint or create sculptures to try expressing life there are musicians who write music and writers who write stories that try to explain life many have different opinions on what the meaning is some say life is a war zone where we are the soldiers fighting in that war for survival some think it is all about the relationships that we make in our life some

over our or the universe s actions since we are all just imitating a different universe we can never really know philosophies such as nihilism and absurdism deny that life has any meaning or maybe the

ryle called mind the ghost in the machine he said the idea that it was separate from the brain was the mistaken official doctrine however some think that mind is separate from the body and is called a soul see dualism many people argue about what makes up the mind some say that only reason and memory are part of the mind because they are conscious in this view the emotions like love hate fear and joy are different from the mind some people with this view say the emotions are part of the heart others argue that our rational and emotional states cannot be separated and should all be part of what we call the mind people often use mind to mean the same as thought the way we talk to ourselves inside our heads this is where the sayings make up our minds change our minds and of two minds come from one of the important things of the mind in this sense is that it is private no one else can know our mind the original meaning of the old english gemynd was memory this explains the sayings call to mind come to mind keep in mind to have mind of and so on old english had other words to express what we call mind today such as hyge meaning mind spirit the word mind gradually grew to mean all

are many things in our environment that might make what is mentally healthy different from one person to another in general most experts agree that mental health and mental illness are not opposites in other words not having a mental illness does not mean you are in good mental health one way to study mental health is by looking at how well a person lives signs of mental health include feeling capable and happy being able to handle normal levels of stress making and keeping friends leading an independent life and being able to recover from difficult situations philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind and how it is linked to the body the main problem is how the mind is related to the body but there are also questions about the nature of the mind that do not talk about its relation to the physical body dualism and monism are the two main ways people try to solve the mind body problem dualism is when people believe that the mind and body are in some way separate from each other it can be traced back to plato aristotle and the samkhya and yoga schools of hindu philosophy but it was most precisely formulated by ren descartes in the th century monism is the belief that mind and body are not physiologically and ontologically distinct kinds of entities this view was first seen in western philosophy by parmenides in the th century bc and was later held by the th century rationalist baruch spinoza according to spinoza mind and body are two parts of a larger being idealists think that the mind is all that exists and that the outside world is actually made up by the mind physicalists think that everything can be expressed by what is physical neutral monists believe that everything can be either mental or physical depending how you see it for example a red spot on a wall is physical because it is an actual thing depending on the physical wall but it is mental because our brain responds to the colour the most common monisms in

nastika heterodox are technical terms in hinduism used to classify philosophical schools and persons according to whether they accept the authority of the vedas as supreme revealed scriptures or not by this definition nyaya vaisheshika samkhya yoga purva mimamsa and vedanta are classified as astika schools while charvaka jainism and buddhism are considered nastika schools in non technical usage the term astika is sometimes loosely translated as theist while nastika is translated as atheist however this interpretation is distinct from the use of the term in hindu philosophy notably even among the astika schools samkhya and the early mimamsa school do not accept a god see atheism in hinduism while accepting the authority of the vedas they thus are atheistic astika schools the three main heterodox schools of indian philosophy do not base their beliefs on vedic authority the use of the term nastika to describe buddhism and jainism in india is explained by gavin flood as follows at an early period during the formation of the upani ads and the rise of buddhism and jainism we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non orthodox veda rejecting and orthodox veda accepting traditions these schools such as buddhism and jainism are understandably regarded as heterodox n stika by orthodox stika brahmanism the tantric traditions in hinduism have both astika and nastika lines as banerji writes in tantra in bengal tantras are also divided as stika or vedic and n stika or non vedic in accordance

called a want every person has the same basic needs for the body humans have bodily needs of water food clothing and shelter to live the need for water is the most important because a person will die very quickly when they do not have drinking water in a warm place food is the next most important need in a cold place the need for clothes or shelter may be next most important because a person will soon die when they do not have these other human needs are not so certain they are mostly needs for the mind it is often said that a person needs love family and friends these needs are for personal relationships they may also be wants it is true that a life may be better with these things but some friends can be bad or bad sometimes good relationships can make life very happy thinking about a

decision theory the paradox goes as follows imagine a super intelligent entity known as omega and suppose you are confident in its ability to predict your choices maybe omega is an alien from a planet that s much more technologically advanced than ours you know that omega has often correctly predicted your choices in the past and has never made an incorrect prediction about your choices and you also know that omega has correctly predicted the choices of other people many of whom are similar to you in the particular situation about to be described there are two boxes a and b box a is see through and contains box b is opaque and contains either or you may take both boxes or only take box b omega decides how much money to put into box b if omega believes that you will take both boxes then he will put in box b if omega believes that you will only take box b then he will put in box b omega makes its prediction puts the money in box b or presents the boxes to you and flies away omega does not tell you its prediction and you do not see how much money omega put in box b what do you do if omega is always right then omega would only put in box b when you choose to take only box b since is more preferable than only choosing box b makes the most sense and since omega is always right then you should choose box b since omega has already left the amount of money in box b won t change based on the decision you make regardless of what s in box b you can always get another by walking away by both boxes", " objectivity is a philosophical opinion or method that believes that reality exists outside of the human mind people can separate their own ideas and opinions from the observations they make objective observations are true no matter who makes the observation being

because we can imagine a perfect being there must be a god the idea is that existing makes a good thing better than one that s only imaginary so the perfect thing we re imagining must exist then we call the perfect thing god the earliest objection was that an argument like that could prove wrong things you could prove that a perfect island must exist for example but no real island is perfect because it starts with imagination not what you can see or experience this is a kind of a priori reasoning david hume didn t like that way of thinking he believed that knowledge had to come from experience and called everything else nothing but sophistry and illusion other versions of the argument start with the idea of the universe and from that argue that there must be a god", " ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being becoming existence or reality it is part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics ontology deals with questions about what things exist or can be said to exist and how such entities can be grouped according to similarities and differences ontology asks whether categories of being are fundamental some philosophers of the platonic school say that all nouns including abstract nouns refer to actual entities other philosophers contend that nouns do not always name entities they think some are a kind of shorthand for a collection of either objects or events in this view mind instead of referring to an entity refers to a collection of mental events experienced by a person society refers to a collection of persons with some shared characteristics and geometry refers to a collection of a specific kind of intellectual activity between these poles called realism and nominalism are other positions any ontology must give an account of which words refer to entities which do not why and what categories result", " ordinary language philosophy is a way of doing philosophy that uses ordinary everyday words it came out of analytic philosophy the most common way of doing philosophy in english speaking countries in the th century analytic philosophers like bertrand russell thought that ordinary language was confused and tried to

exhibit represent expose and that from para beside beyond and deiknumi to show to point out paradigm can also be used to refer to a set of ideas about a given subject the idea that the earth is the center of the universe or that the earth and other planets move around the sun are examples of paradigms one of the first modern people to use the word was georg christoph lichtenberg an th century mathematician and scientist in rhetoric paradeigma is known as a type of proof the purpose of paradeigma is to provide an audience with an illustration of similar occurrences this illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion however it is used to help guide them there a personal accountant is a good comparison of paradeigma to explain how it is meant to guide the audience it is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what and what not to spend their money on but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals anaximenes defined paradeigma as actions that have occurred previously and are similar to or the opposite of those which we are now discussing aristotle uses the word in a similar way in inductive logic usually induction is used to get from a number of special cases to a general one aristotle uses the word to get from one special case to another the original greek term paradeigma was used in greek texts such as plato s timaeus a as the model or the pattern that the demiurge god used to create the cosmos the term had a technical meaning in the field of grammar the merriam webster dictionary defines its technical use only in the context of grammar or in rhetoric as a term for an illustrative parable or fable in linguistics ferdinand de saussure used paradigm to refer to a class of elements with similarities", " pascal s wager or pascal s gambit is the name for an idea that blaise pascal had he said that it is not possible to prove or disprove that god exists therefore it is better to bet that god exists if god existed and the person believed in god he would be rewarded with happiness forever if the person did not believe he would be punished with what is called eternal damnation if god did not exist it would make no difference for this reason it would be better to believe in god pascal said indeed pascal strongly believed in this ideal pascal s argument is a simple one reason and intellect cannot decide the question of whether god exists or not therefore it makes sense to choose the option that would benefit us most should we be right accordingly the options would be as follows you may live a religious and moral life and be rewarded by eternal happiness you may live a pleasure seeking life and be denied eternal happiness you may live a holy life but there is actually no god or eternal life you may live a pleasure seeking life but it makes no difference because there is no god for pascal the first of these options is the most important one because it represents the maximum gain and loss even if it should turn out that there is no god the sheer risk of deciding against such a possibility warrants that we should take that option the argument from inconsistent revelations shows we have no idea which hell to avoid since many different religions exist with different beliefs about hell within religions there are different denominations and sects with different ideas about heaven and hell if we try to avoid the hell that christians believe in we are at risk from the hell muslims believe so it goes on perhaps god does not like people who accept pascal s wager but god may not mind that atheists doubt atheists and believers could both be in trouble or neither could be in trouble further three abrahamic religions judaism christianity and islam claim worshiping other gods is sinful we have no proof that any particular deity is real and can easily choose the wrong god therefore we are safer worshiping a god or gods that are less exclusive and will not punish us for making the wrong choice pierre de fermat and pascal created probability theory pascal s wager was very important for the time because it did new things with probability theory

philosopher philosophy is a way of thinking about the world the universe and society in the past sciences were part of philosophy as well the ideas in philosophy are often general and abstract but this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world ethics for example asks about how to be good in our day to day lives metaphysics asks about how the world works and what it is made of sometimes people talk about how they have a personal philosophy which means the way a person thinks about the world this article is not about people s personal philosophies this article is about the ideas that have been discussed by philosophers people who think and write about ways of thinking for a long time one philosophical question is this is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it other questions asked by philosophers are these the etymological meaning of the word philosophy is love of wisdom it comes from the greek word philosophia with philo meaning beloved and sophia meaning wisdom there are different types of philosophy from different times and places some philosophers came from ancient greece such as plato and aristotle others came from asia such as confucius or buddha and laozi some philosophers are from the middle ages in europe such as william of ockham or saint thomas aquinas philosophers from the s s and s included thomas hobbes ren descartes john locke david hume and immanuel kant philosophers from the s included s ren kierkegaard ludwig wittgenstein and jean paul sartre philosophy is the study of humans and the world by thinking and asking questions it is a science and an art philosophy tries to answer important questions by coming up with answers about real things and asking why sometimes philosophy tries to answer the same questions as religion and science philosophers do not all give the same answers to a question many types of philosophy criticize or even attack the beliefs of science and religion in his work critique of pure reason immanuel kant asked the following questions the answers to these questions gives the different domains or categories of philosophy philosophy can be divided into different groups based on the types of questions that it asks below is a list of questions split into groups one possible list of answers to these questions can be called a philosophy there are many different philosophies because all of these questions have many different answers according to different people not all philosophies ask the same questions these are the questions that are usually asked by philosophers from the western world metaphysics metaphysics is sometimes split up into ontology the philosophy of real life and living things the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of religion but these sub branches are very close together ontology the philosophy of mind the philosophy of religion in epistemology in ethics in aesthetics in logic in axiology other divisions include eschatology teleology and theology in past centuries natural science was included in philosophy and called natural philosophy does philosophy do any good very few people would dispute this it is easy to argue that philosophy is a good thing because it helps people to think more clearly philosophy helps people to understand the world and the way people act and think philosophers believe that asking philosophical questions is useful because it brings wisdom and helps people to learn about the world and each other some philosophers might even argue that the question is philosophy good or bad is a philosophical question itself however some people think that philosophy is harmful as philosophy encourages free thinking and often questions the beliefs that others hold for example philosophies such as some existentialist views say that there is no meaning to life or human existence except the meaning that we make up or invent people from some religions do not agree with the beliefs of existentialism every major science including physics biology and chemistry are disciplines that were once considered as philosophy medicine was always considered a practical art however as facts about nature became more understood these subjects branched away psychology only split a century and a half ago in our own time subjects such as consciousness studies decision theory and applied ethics have increasingly found independence from philosophy as a whole because of this philosophy seems useful because it spins off new kinds of science philosophers ask questions about ideas concepts they try to find answers to those questions some thinkers find it very hard to find those words that best describe the ideas they have when they find answers to some of these questions philosophers often have the same problem that is how to best tell the answers they found to other people depending on the meaning of the words they use the answers change some philosophers are full time thinkers called academics who work for universities or colleges these philosophers write books and articles about philosophy and teach classes about philosophy to university or college students other philosophers are just hobby thinkers who think about philosophy during their free time a small number of hobby thinkers have thought so much about philosophy that they are able to write articles for philosophy magazines other people approach philosophy from another job for example monks artists and scientists may think about philosophical ideas and questions most philosophers work by asking questions and looking for good definitions meanings of words to help them understand what a question means some philosophers say the only thing needed to answer a question is to find out what it means the only thing that makes philosophical questions such as those above difficult is that people do not really know what they mean ludwig wittgenstein believed this philosophers often use both real and imaginary examples to make a point for example they may write about a real or fictional person in order to show what they think a good person or a bad person is like some philosophers look for the simplest way to answer a question and say that is probably the right answer this is a process called occam s razor others believe that complicated answers to questions can also be right for an example of a philosophical problem see the god paradox philosophers use logic to solve problems and answer questions logical consistency is a cornerstone of any acceptable theory philosophers who disagree with a theory will often try to find a logical contradiction in a theory if they find a contradiction this gives them a reason to reject that theory if they do not find an inconsistency the philosopher might show that the theory leads to a conclusion which is either unacceptable or ridiculous this second approach is usually called reductio ad absurdum people listed here should be genuine philosophers rather than social or political campaigners the lists are not meant to be complete", " philosophy of language is the study of how languages were created and are used it is part of linguistics in continental philosophy it is not treated as a subject by itself but ludwig wittgenstein and other analytic philosophers placed particular stress on it like all philosophies there are some central questions that are important in philosophy of language history ancient greek plato was the first philosopher we know was interested in philosophy of language although his teacher socrates probably was too he believed that the smallest parts of words phonemes had meaning even if they were outside the words they are in this is not a very good theory and plato understood that there were things wrong with it the stoics also made a complicated philosophy of the middle ages the medieval scholars such as william occam also were interested in philosophy of language occam was the first philosopher to think about the possibility of a mental language he also discussed how a word can refer to both its meaning and the actual word itself modernity philosophy of language only became more popular in the twentieth century when ferdinand de saussure wrote his book course in general linguistics since then philosophy of language has played an important part in philosophy as a whole", " the philosophy of mathematics is a kind of philosophy that tries to study what mathematics really is philosophers of math ask themselves questions like none of those questions has a clear answer so mathematicians are free to choose which answers they like for example mathematicians who believe in platonism think that numbers are real just like rocks and trees we can t see them but we can represent them with symbols and use them to study the world mathematicians who believe in fictionalism think that math is just made up numbers shapes and other things in math are just ways that we use to make science possible but they don t really exist mathematicians who believe in logicism believe that math is true because it is based on true sentences called axioms it does not matter if numbers and shapes exist or not just that they represent true things mathematicians who believe in finitism think that everything that makes sense has a beginning and an end things like infinity don t exist", " philosophy of mind is one part of philosophy that works with the mind it is about thinking how the mind works and how it relates to the world it also deals with consciousness which is also researched in psychology and physics the mind body problem is the main problem that is talked about in philosophy of mind it is the problem of how our minds and our bodies are related and what exactly the mind is many different answers have been come up with to solve the mind body problem most of them fall into the two groups of dualism and monism dualism is the belief that minds and bodies are separate things one of the main dualist views comes from ren descartes and is named cartesian dualism after him it is also called substance dualism because he thought that minds and bodies were two completely different substances like matter in the world monism is the opposite of dualism because it is the belief that minds and bodies are not separate things many monist views are called materialism because they think that minds are not anything different from matter just like bodies", " philosophy of religion is a branch of philosophy religions and religious beliefs can manifest themselves in different ways philosophy of religion looks into explaining certain answers to questions of religion using understanding it is also looks into different ways religions are practiced and their importance for the everyday lives of the people practicing them other domains of it include criticism and analysis of religious texts using philosophy of language according to winfried l ffler philiosphers of religion can be grouped as follows many of the philosophers mentioned belong to more than one group philosophy of religion also looks at more practical matters like defining the features that make up a religion there are two main schools of thought the one called essentialist says that all religions have a common essence the following have been proposed the problem with this is that using only these definitions leas to a common philiosphy of religion that is harly usable for studies the other approach called functional tries to counter this rather than trying to get an abstract idea of religion it looks at the use or function religion has in the live of people or societies among the things mentioned are that religions help keep a psychological equilibrium and that they provide a certain amount of stability to a society thinkers with this opion include karl marx mile durkheim bronis aw malinowski and talcott parsons critics of these theories say that such explanations often go against common sense as religions can also have the popposite effect to that mentioned other topics include arguments for the existence of god the problem of evil divine attributes and the relationship between science and religion important philosophers of religion include thomas aquinas augustine and alvin plantinga philosophers of religion can be religious or non religious ", " philosophy of science is the part of philosophy that studies the sciences philosophers who are interested in science study how knowledge is built up by scientists and what makes science different from other activities no doubt modern science has advanced knowledge in a wide range of fields how has it done this to tackle this issue a number of other issues have to be tackled also in earlier times some have thought science was nothing but organised common sense thomas henry huxley thought this however as the twentieth century went on science produced many ideas which were nothing like common sense then it was clear that science really was something different from commonsense knowledge but what was it this is called the demarcation problem the demarcation problem refers to the distinction between science and non science including pseudoscience karl popper called this the central question in the philosophy of science no account of the problem has got full agreement among philosophers some regard the problem as insoluble or uninteresting the logical positivists tried to base science on observation in their view truth was achieved by verification non science was non observational and meaningless against that popper argued that the central property of science is falsifiability all scientific claims can be proved false at least in principle if no such proof can be found despite sufficient effort then the claim is likely true popper s ideas were applauded by many scientists like peter medawar however sceptics noticed that theories were often not discarded when a prediction was refuted the theory was simply adjusted to take into account the new findings it was clear from this that although falsifiability was important it could not be a simple way to distinguish science from non science other approaches were tried one idea that science was a problem solving process aimed at finding answers to questions of course many other fields try to answer questions and solve problems another approach was to define science as the search for objective truth but objectivity is very difficult to define and whether science really is objective is open to question with biology the situation was rather different there were many thousands of published observations and what was achieved by darwin was to show that sense could be made of the observations if it were the case that evolution had taken place in a natural history science such as biology geology or astronomy one of the main jobs of science is to explain what has happened and what is seen obviously explanations as well as observations and theories are part of the philosophy of science both theory and observations are part of science and they are tied together in a kind of cycle a very clear example was the prediction of einstein that a source of gravity such as a star would bend light passing nearby an expedition was organised in to record the positions of stars around the sun during a solar eclipse the observation of star positions showed that the apparent star positions close to the sun were changed slightly from their normal expected positions in effect the light passing the sun was pulled towards the sun by gravitation this confirmed predictions of gravitational lensing made by albert einstein in the general theory of relativity published in this was the first solid evidence in favour of einstein s theory the point here is that the observation and the theory were connected the observation would not have been made but for the theory and then the observation was convincing evidence in favour of the theory the theory had passed a critical test since then many more tests have been made of einstein s ideas and all have been consistent with his theory according to common sense science begins with observations all scientific knowledge come from the facts of experience theories are produced by observation of these facts and are then tested by prediction here is a schema of this idea of science that some philosophers call a naive conception of science this naive conception is not held by many philosophers today for one thing it sees science as a one way engine from facts what are they to theories and predictions as shown by the einstein example where a theory led the other way round the model does not fit much of science in fact the relationship between the parts of a scientific philosophy are extremely complex according to pierre duhem and w v quine it is impossible to test a theory in isolation for example to test newton s law of gravitation in our solar system one needs information about the masses and positions of the sun and all the planets famously the failure to predict the orbit of uranus in the th century did not lead to the rejection of newton s law instead it lead to the rejection of the hypothesis that there are only seven planets in our solar system the investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet neptune if a test fails something is wrong but there is a problem in figuring out what that something is a missing planet badly calibrated test equipment an unsuspected curvature of space etc one consequence of the duhem quine thesis is that any theory can be made compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of extra ad hoc hypotheses this is why science uses occam s razor hypotheses without justification are eliminated this led karl popper to reject na ve falsification in favor of survival of the fittest or most falsifiable of scientific theories in popper s view any hypothesis that does not make testable predictions is simply not science such a hypothesis may be useful or valuable but it cannot be said to be science w v quine thought that empirical data are not enough to make a judgment between theories in this view a theory can always be made to fit with the available empirical data however this does not necessarily imply that all theories are of equal value because scientists often use guiding principles such as occam s razor one result of this view is that specialists in the philosophy of science stress the requirement that observations made for the purposes of science be restricted to intersubjective objects that is science is restricted to those areas where there is general agreement on the nature of the observations involved it is comparatively easy to agree on observations of physical phenomena harder to agree on observations of social or mental phenomena and difficult in the extreme to reach agreement on matters of theology or ethics and thus the latter remain outside the normal purview of science is there any scientific method at all paul feyerabend argued that no description of scientific method could possibly encompass all the approaches and methods used by scientists feyerabend objected to prescriptive scientific method on the grounds that any such method would stifle and cramp scientific progress feyerabend claimed the only principle that does not inhibit progress is anything goes thomas kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded he argued that observations always rely on a specific paradigm and that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently by paradigm he meant a consistent portrait of the world one that involves no logical contradictions and that is consistent with observations made from the point of view of the paradigm more than one such logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other theory against theory neither is a standard by which the other can be judged instead the question is which portrait is judged by some set of people to promise the most useful in terms of scientific puzzle solving for kuhn the choice of paradigm was sustained by but not ultimately determined by logical processes the individual s choice between paradigms involves setting two or more portraits against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising in the case of a general acceptance of one paradigm or another kuhn believed that it represented the consensus of the community of scientists acceptance or rejection of some paradigm is he argued a social process as much as a logical process kuhn s position however is not one of relativism according to kuhn a paradigm shift occurs when a number of observational anomalies problems in the old paradigm have made the new paradigm more useful that is the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm a new paradigm is chosen because it does a better job of solving scientific problems than the old one the fact that observation is embedded in theory does not mean observations are irrelevant to science scientific understanding derives from observation but the acceptance of scientific statements is dependent on the related theoretical paradigm as well as on observation of course further testing may resolve differences of opinion", " political philosophy is the study of politics liberty justice property and rights also the law and its enforcement a legal code by authority it

most of post structuralism is about saying that structuralism is wrong the people we call post structuralists who wrote about structuralism all had different ideas a common idea among them was not liking how some structuralists thought the whole world could be thought of as symbols that are opposite to each other they thought that things in life and in media are more complex than that so that thinking this is the opposite of that was silly a lot of the time the post structuralists said that the things that we think of as the ends of a binary were really made up by other people and were not really useful or true structuralism says that we can see human culture as a structure that looks like language it also says that this is not reality but we can use a third order that makes a bridge between the two a post structuralist might say that to build meaning out of that you have to make a mistake and think that the definitions of things are good and don t change post structualists might also say that the structuralist theory is above and not a part of from these structures they are writing things about post structuralist writers write about how structuralism is too stiff and is wrong to put things in categories writers that have been called post structuralists include roland barthes jacques derrida michel foucault gilles deleuze judith butler jean baudrillard and julia kristeva although some did not want to be called post structuralist", " the problem of evil is the question whether evil exists and if so does it disprove the existence of god certain religions say there is a god who is all loving all knowing and all powerful in these religions the question to answer is how an all loving and all powerful god could allow evil to exist responses include the argument that if there is free will evil must necessarily exist that humans cannot understand god that evil is simply being without god or that there is evil because the world is corrupted and fallen from grace a version of the problem of evil perhaps by epicurus goes as follows another argument goes arguments such as these are about the logical problem of evil they attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and cannot therefore all be correct a common response is that god can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good some philosophers accept that arguments such as god allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that god and evil are logically incompatible even a highly implausible instance of god s coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism for logical positivism the issue with god is the lack of any independent method of verification in their view this makes the proposition god exists not true or false but meaningless a similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified", " a proposition is a term in philosophy and logic it is a statement which has a truth value meaning it can be proved to be true or false for a proposition to be valid it must be possible to prove the proposition is either true or false many teachers and students of logic use the term statement and proposition to mean the same thing propositions are also often represented by capital letters such as p displaystyle p q displaystyle q and r displaystyle r it is possible to express the same proposition in many way proposition are only concerned with actual meaning not the way the proposition is expressed propositions can look different yet still mean the same thing when two different propositions mean the same thing they are said to be synonymous meaning each statement has the same meaning for example snow is white in english and schnee ist wei in german are different sentences because they are written in different languages however they mean exactly the same thing snow is white no matter what language the statement is written in it will mean the same thing as a result these statements are synonymous in aristotelian logic a proposition is a specific kind of sentence that confirms or denies an action or predicate took place through a subject aristotelian propositions take forms like all men are mortal and socrates is a man in each sentence the subject men socrates has a status are mortal is a man which can be regarded as true or false in logical positivism a proposition whose truth value cannot possibly be decided is meaningless quine for instance believes that propositions generally have no clear criterion of identity for example statements about the existence of deities cannot be proved under logical positivism because the statements have no truth value a logical positivist would consider propositions about deities such as god exists or god does not exist to have no logical meaning", " qualia is a term philosophers use for bits of perception or subjective conscious experience it is in the field called the philosophy of psychology or

most important factor in any decision is how they will personally benefit then self interested or even selfish behavior would be rational but if they believe that benefiting a group of people is more important than benefiting just one person then purely selfish behavior is irrational determinations of rationality depend on context the background information and assumptions", " reason or reasoning is a way of thinking that uses logic and facts people can use reason to decide what is true or best it is different from obeying tradition or emotions to decide what things are best or true in common

from the sanskrit words satya meaning truth and agraha insistence or holding firmly to for gandhi satyagraha went far beyond just passive resistance resisting without taking action according to him it was a moral force born of truth and non violence his non violence also became his strength he said that he chose the name because truth means love and insistence means force and the sanskrit name showed it was a force born from truth and love non violence he also wrote that he liked the term civil resistance better than civil disobedience gandhi also translated it as love force or soul force in satyagraha the goal gandhi said is to change the mind of the wrong doer not to force him winning means getting along with the enemy to make what is wrong right again which they might not realize is

questioning the central technique of the socratic method is called an elenchus it means argument to disprove or refute prove wrong our knowledge of socrates comes mainly from plato who was one of his pupils no writing by socrates survives socrates was famous for not answering questions in a direct manner i know that i know nothing he said socrates s stated position as presented in plato s dialogues was that other person already knew the answer to a question he s only drew out what was already in the other s mind in plato s early dialogues the elenchus is the technique socrates uses to investigate ethical concepts such as justice or virtue according to one scholar it has the following steps the exact nature of the elenchus is subject to a great deal of debate in particular whether it is a positive method leading to knowledge or a negative method used solely to refute false claims to knowledge according to w k c guthrie the socratic method was intended to demonstrate one s ignorance socrates unlike the sophists did believe that knowledge was possible but believed that the first step to knowledge was recognition of one s ignorance guthrie writes socrates was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance while they were not the essence of the socratic

who were a group of teachers of philosophy and rhetoric in the modern definition a sophism is a confusing or slightly incorrect argument used for deceiving someone the word sophism originated from the

greek philosopher protagoras ca bc is often said to be the first of the sophists others include gorgias prodicus hippias thrasymachus lycophron callicles antiphon and cratylus plato opposed those sophists because they only abused wisdom for their own interest and refused the truth and justice in modern usage sophism sophist and sophistry are derogatory terms due the influence of many philosophers in the past sophism and platonism were rival schools as enemies of each other a sophism is a statement to deceive someone in a debate or conversation it might be made to seem to make sense when really being wrong or it might use difficult words and complicated sentences to intimidate the audience into agreeing an argument ad hominem is an example of sophistry a sophist is a person who uses sophisms sophistry means using sophisms for subtly deceptive reasoning or argumentation", " the theory known as spontaneous generation held that complex living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances mice might spontaneously appear in stored grain or maggots could spontaneously appear in meat according to aristotle it was a readily observable truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls on plants fleas from putrid matter mice from dirty hay crocodiles from logs rotting at the bottom of bodies of water and so forth in the th century these things started to be questioned sir thomas browne wrote a book called pseudodoxia epidemica he subtitled it enquiries into very many received tenets and commonly presumed truths he published it in he wrote it as an attack on false beliefs and vulgar errors scientists failed to accept the conclusions he reached for example alexander ross a scientist who lived at the same time as browne wrote about it to question this he meant to question spontaneous generation is to question reason sense and experience if he doubts of this let him go to egypt and there he will find the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of nylus to the great calamity of the inhabitants in the physician girolamo fracastoro theorized that epidemic diseases were caused by tiny invisible particles or spores which might not be living creatures but this was not widely accepted next robert hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism in he is also credited for naming the cell which he discovered while observing cork samples in anthony van leeuwenhoek discovered microorganisms that were probably protozoa and bacteria this sparked new interest in the microscopic world the first step was taken by the italian francesco redi in redi proved that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs from the th century onwards it was gradually shown that at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false the alternative seemed to be omne vivum ex ovo that every living thing came from a pre existing living thing literally everything from an egg in lazzaro spallanzani proved that microbes came from the air and could be killed by boiling yet it was not until that louis pasteur performed a series of careful experiments with these experiments pasteur proved that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not appear in nutrient rich media of their own accord in non living material this experiment supported

makes a distinction between the beautiful and the sublime there is no such distinction in eastern philosophy the first known work in philiosphy treating the sublime is called on the sublime and was written by an otherwise unknown writer who lived in the first or third century this writer is often called longinus longinus was a teacher of rhetoric and used the sublime to describe great language in this context according to longinus the sublime inspires awe and veneration with greater persuasive powers nicolas boileau despr aux translated this work into french in the th century in the th

purpose a simpler example would be a tool such as the clock which is designed by man to tell the time whether or not an entity man or god is needed to cause teleology to happen is one of the most important questions all cultures we know of have creation stories in their religions however much of science operates on the principle that the natural world is self organising this applies particularly to astronomy and biology which were once explained as the action of a deity and are now seen as natural and automatically self organising cybernetics is the basic science of self organising systems the general issue of whether the original sense of teleology applies to the natural world is still a matter of controversy between religion and science ", " the theory of forms is a philosophical idea held by the famous greek philosopher plato plato believed that behind every single thing in our world there is a form which is the true eternal essence of that thing we can explain this view with an example in the world there are many different horses big horses and small horses grey horses and white horses old horses and young horses and so forth according to plato each horse is an imperfect copy of the horse form the one true horse in other words they are all imitations of the perfect horse plato uses shadows as an analogy like a tree forms a shadow so is the tree itself a shadow of the form the one true tree the theory of forms applies not only to physical objects but also to abstract concepts such as beauty anger good and evil plato also explains that it is impossible for us to perceive these forms through our senses like our sense of hearing or sense of seeing the only way we can truly understand a form is through the use of logic and mathematics

consciousness the mind body problem i e the relationship of the mind to the body especially the brain is a central issue in philosophy of mind the mind body problem has to do with the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds or mental processes and bodily states or processes the main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states processes and how or even if minds are affected by and can affect the body our perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states ultimately causing us to feel a sensation which may be pleasant or unpleasant someone s desire for a hat for example will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants the question then is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray

ancient times people developed calendars to keep track of the number of days in a year they also developed sundials that used the moving shadows cast by the sun through the day to measure times

problem was invented by oxford university philosophy professor philippa foot in the s but it might have been someone else foot wrote about the trolley problem and other problems in her essay the problem of abortion and the doctrine of the double effect massachusetts institute of technology professor judith jarvis thomson made the trolley problem famous now many schools teach the trolley problem for a while there was even a part of philosophy called trolleyology jarvis thomson named the problem the trolley problem the trolley problem does not have a right or wrong answer instead it is a way to make people think and talk about what makes actions good or bad and why the player you is on a trolley a fast moving cart that can only run on a track it is not an automobile that can be driven off the edge of a road it must stay on a track ahead of the player five people are standing on the track where the trolley will run over them and kill them the player has no way to stop the trolley the only thing the player can do is throw a switch to make the trolley change onto a different track on this second track there is one person none of the six people have time to move out of the way in jarvis thomson s version the person controlling the trolley switch is not on the trolley instead this player is watching from the side this person can throw the switch but they can also choose to do nothing if the player does nothing the trolley will kill five people if the player throws the switch the trolley will kill one person there are different versions of the trolley problem what if the player knows something about the individual people on the track the player is a doctor working in an emergency room a homeless person or traveler comes to the emergency room but the doctor learns he is not sick at all upstairs in the hospital there are five sick people who need organ transplants the homeless person is a perfect match for all five like in the trolley problem the doctor can kill one person by taking action or allow five people to die by doing nothing the emergency room case was also in foot s essay most people think the emergency room problem is different from the trolley problem even though the numbers are the same the trolley problem is something that could happen in real life but would be very rare healthy people going to emergency rooms every day in the emergency room problem many many things can affect the player s decision the students say things like the player is a doctor and doctors are taught not to hurt or kill people so the player will say no instead of saying what they themselves would do or they would say things like if the doctors kill the homeless person people will find out about it they will be worried that the doctors will kill them for their organs so they will not go to the emergency room when they need to then more than five people will die sick people who did not go to the emergency room for help these things are true but they mean the emergency room case is very complicated for a thought experiment philosophers invented the footbridge problem as a better version of the emergency room problem unlike in the emergency room problem there are no societal systems that get in the way for example the doctor s education or people deciding not to go to the emergency room in the footbridge problem the player is standing on a small bridge over a trolley track again there is a trolley with no brakes heading very fast toward five people it will hit and kill the people if nothing stops it they cannot get out of the way there is also a second person on the footbridge if the player pushes this one person off the footbridge then their body will stop the trolley saving the five other people but the one person whom the player has pushed will die in this problem the person the player would push is big and fat enough to stop the trolley but the player is not other variations on the trolley problem include when the player knows some or all of the people on the tracks another is when the big fat person on the footbridge put the five people on the track on purpose so they would be run over another is when the one person whom the trolley can run over instead of the other five is a person taking a nap in a hammock instead of someone standing on a trolley track a team of scientists led by joshua greene put people in an fmri machine to watch what their brains did while they thought about the trolley problem and its other versions when people thought about pulling the trolley switch to kill one person instead of five the parts of the brain that do cool rational thinking the prefrontal cortex lit up when people thought about pushing a fat man onto the track the parts of their brain that do emotion the amygdala lit up the people decided not to push the fat man onto the track greene and the other scientists said they think human beings are more likely to make moral decisions using intuition when they are feeling emotions for example the disgust they feel at the thought of killing an innocent fat man green and the other scientists said they think human beings are more likely to make decisions using logic when their emotions are not involved the trolley problem appeared in the episode the trolley problem on the second season of the sitcom the good place", " universal reason is something that

is one that is able to develop moral values which are not based on religion but rather rooted in nihilism when nietsche used the term he took most of the ideas from the french philosopher claude adrien helv tius helvetius used the term homme sup rieur the idea itself is much older dionysius of halicarnassus talked about a hyperanthropos hyper above anthropos human in the first century bc he lived c after bc and was a greek historian and teacher of rhetoric lucian used the term to talk about noblemen who would be cut back to their real size in the realm of the dead in his divine comedy dante used the hapax legomenon transhumanar to refer to the bermensch transhumanar is a verb the writings of pseudo dionysius the areopagite influenced dante pseudo dyonysius is an early christian writer from syria who lived in the th century he is not known by name but used the pen name dionysius areopagita dionysius areopagita lived in the st century and was one of the bishops of athens

{"name": "Psychology", "articles": [" psychology is the study of the mind its thought feeling and behaviour it is an academic discipline which involves the scientific study of mental faculties functions and behaviours psychology deals mainly with humans but also sometimes with nonhuman animals because psychology may be difficult to study as a whole psychologists often only look at small parts of it at one time psychology has much in common with many other fields and overlaps with many of them some of these fields are medicine ethology computer science and linguistics in this field a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and is a social behavioural or cognitive scientist psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior they also explore the physiological and neurobiological processes which underlie cognitive functions and behaviors psychology has been split up into smaller parts called branches these are subjects in psychology that try to answer a particular group of questions about how people think some branches of psychology that are often studied are psychology is a type of science and research psychologists use many of the same types of methods that researchers from other natural and social sciences use psychologists make theories to try to explain a behavior or pattern they see based on their theory they make some predictions they then carry out an experiment or collect other types of information that will tell them whether their predictions were right or wrong some types of experiments cannot be done on people because the process would be too long expensive dangerous unfair or otherwise unethical there are also other ways psychologists study the mind and behavior scientifically and test their theories psychologists might wait for some events to happen on their own they might look at patterns among existing groups of people in natural environments or they might do experiments on animals which can be simpler and more ethical to study psychology shares other things with natural sciences as well for example a good psychological theory may be possible to prove wrong just like in any natural science a group of psychologists can never be completely sure that their theory is the right one if a theory can be proved wrong but experiments do not prove it wrong then it is more likely that the theory is accurate this is called falsifiability psychologists use many tools as part of their daily work psychologists use surveys to ask people how they feel and what they think they may use special devices to look at the brain and to see what it is doing psychologists use computers to collect data as they measure how people behave in response to pictures words symbols or other stimuli psychologists also use statistics to help them analyze the data that they get from their experiments not all psychology is scientific psychology psychodynamic psychology and depth psychology do things like interpreting people s dreams to understand the unconscious mind they are older approaches to psychology begun by carl jung who was particularly interested in finding methods for measuring what kind of personality people have humanistic psychology and existential psychology also believe that it is more important to understand personal meaning than to find causes and effects of mental processes and behaviors psychologists are people who work in the field of psychology a psychologist may work in either basic research or applied research basic research is the study of people or animals to learn more about them applied research is using what was learned from basic research to solve real world problems if he or she is qualified as a clinical psychologist they may be a therapist or counsellor as well as a researcher to become a psychologist a person must first get a basic degree at a university and then go to graduate school a master s degree either msc master of science or ma master of arts allows work such as a school psychologist a doctorate degree takes a longer time because it includes doing research and writing a detailed report called a dissertation or thesis the doctoral graduate uses the initials phd or dphil doctor of philosophy after his or her name some clinical psychologists earn a doctor of psychology degree and use the initials psyd after their name the american psychological association says that people need a phd or psyd and a current state license in the u s in order to call themselves a psychologist the words psychologist and psychiatrist may be confused with each other a psychiatrist has graduated from medical school and uses the initials md or its equivalent mb chb in london university for example a psychiatrist or doctor may work with a psychologist they may prescribe and check on the effect of medications", " abnormal psychology is a part of psychology people who study abnormal psychology are psychologists they are scientists that investigate the mind using the scientific method different cultures tend to have different ideas of how strange abnormal any behaviour is considered this tends to change over time within cultures so people that live in a country at one time in history might consider abnormal what people who live in the same country consider normal years before or years later abnormal psychology is often used to understand or to treat people with mental disorders to make life better for them this is because abnormal behaviour is often defined as when someone is not able to change how they behave to fit different settings this is often also used to define some mental disorders when someone cannot change their behaviour to fit the people and situations around them when they need to it can cause suffering and the person may be uncomfortable when around people their behaviour can be unreasonable and hard to understand their behaviour can even be dangerous not everyone with a mental disorder is unable to adjust to their surroundings people who can change to fit their the environment around them more easily than most people can also have behaviour that is considered abnormal and might also have an easier life with the help of a psychologist a supernatural belief is a belief in a force that is beyond scientific understanding there are a lot of cultures that believe in supernatural events these cultures include religious cultures as well as the ancient chinese ancient egyptians hebrews and ancient greeks these cultures have writings that say abnormal behaviour in the form of supernatural events created demons or gods that would take over a person and act through those people this was called possession in the roman catholic church exorcisms were done to make these demons leave the body of the individuals they possessed exorcism involved prayer noises and potions p people who had abnormal behaviour were often told they were possessed in some cultures trepanation was often used this was when a hole was made in someone s head to release the bad spirit lunatic asylums were buildings that kept patients that had abnormal behaviour they became popular in europe with the madhouse act of although they did exist before the act asylums were meant to look after people who could not take care of themselves but they were known for being cruel and abusive to their patients the buildings were often dirty and not looked after very well during the late s william tuke made a religious retreat for patients this was a turn away from the horrors of mental asylums p also in the late s philippe pinel started to encourage better treatment of the mentally insane today the th century lunatic asylum does not exist most of the asylums were closed in the late s because of the invention of antipsychotic medicines today there are psychiatric hospitals for people with mental illness this includes broadmoor hospital which houses some of britain s the most dangerous criminals with mental illnesses in the s dorothea dix fought against the bad treatment of patients in mental asylums she started a mental hygiene group to encourage politicians to change the treatment of mental patients in the united states when people became aware of the wrongdoing in mental asylums money was raised to improve the treatment of patients and the asylums dix is thought to have helped to create mental hospitals by there were more than patients living in mental asylums most treatments were still cruel to patients and were not effective the asylums were quickly becoming overcrowded mary jane ward wrote a book in called the snake pit that raised awareness of the inhumane treatment of mental patients the national institute of mental health was created the same year the organisation provided training and support for mental patients and workers that cared for them the hill burton act was passed to give money to the mental health hospitals later the community health services act of was passed this law which created outpatient buildings for patients to live at home rather than in hospitals rehabilitation and community care centers were also built under this act p during the late s mental asylums were less accepted the cruel treatment of patients and the overcrowding and ways of living were seen as not needed less money was being given to asylums so many closed all around the world the closing down of mental hospitals became known as deinstitutionalization the movement from asylum to community was meant to help patients development and recovery the lack of good support programs meant that patients felt abandoned and found it hard to fit into normal life this led to many becoming homeless p in the past there were three ways to explain abnormal behaviour these were supernatural biological and psychological explanations western medicine no longer uses supernatural explanations instead we use biological and psychological explanations biological explanations use genetics and neuroscience to explain abnormal behaviours the biological explanation is based on how the brain works and how genes change the way it works psychological explanations use how the mind works to explain abnormal behaviours early cultures believed that abnormal behaviour was from demons spirits and astrology trepanation was when a hole was drilled in a person s head this was done to let the spirits or demons out of the person s head exorcism was practiced mainly by the catholic church exorcism was believed to ward the spirits out of the person that they possessed these practices were normal during the middle ages this was when abnormal behaviour was thought to be a religious issue rather than a psychological one some abnormal behaviour was thought to be witchcraft people accused of witchcraft were almost always punished for the acts in many cases the punishment was to be murdered the biological approach to explaining abnormal behaviour assumes that the behaviour can be explained by physical factors hippocrates was a man who lived during the th century and is thought by many to be the father of modern medicine he did not accept that evil spirits or astronomy were the causes of psychological disorders hippocrates believed that there were natural causes for the disorders and appropriate treatments could be found he focused on the four humors of the brain he believed that the four humours must be balanced for healthy mental states and when one humour was stronger various disorders would appear to balance the humors hippocrates would tell patients to change their lifestyles p there are now new ideas when talking about the biological explanations of psychological disorders but hippocrates focus on mental processes and clinical practice was a revolutionary concept another greek physician called galen also took a scientific approach to the causes of psychological disorders he divided them into physical and mental categories among galen s causes were head injuries alcohol abuse and life experiences during the th century galen s concepts influenced the medical industry galen s focus was on the biological causes for mental disorders p psychological explanations for abnormal behavior sometimes take a behavioral approach in which the positive behaviors are reinforced and negative ones are not this approach is more focused on changing the actual behavior of a person than the true cause of it sigmund freud was one of the most popular psychological theorists of the th century the method he used to study and treat patients was known as psychoanalysis methods of hypnosis by were used by freud but also by franz mesmer and physicians in the nancy school however freud attempted to have his patients confess their deepest truest emotions which was referred to as a catharsis he would have his patients speak freely about themselves in free association also he would conduct dream analysis where patients would record and discuss their dreams freud s work led to other great psychoanalytic theorists such as carl jung alfred adler and harry stack sullivan wilhelm wundt and william james were credited for opening up the first experimental psychology laboratories this led to many studies and psychological methods such as classical conditioning led by ivan pavlov and john b skinner while edward thorndike and b f skinner were the leaders of the study of operant conditioning p the north american reference book used by psychiatrists and psychologists to diagnose and treat psychological disorders is known as the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm it is produced by the american psychiatric association apa the most recent version was released in may of and is known as the dsm the dsm is relied upon by clinicians health insurance companies medicine companies and the legal system as a reference for understanding and identifying mental disorders the dsm divides mental disorders into groups and provides descriptive signs and symptoms that define each disorder in addition it lists statistics for each disorder ranging from its frequency in the general population to the most effective form of treatment before diagnosing an individual with a specific mental disorder a professional must first determine whether that individual does in fact suffer from a mental disorder the dsm defines a mental disorder as a condition that when using the dsm a complete psychiatric diagnosis is split up into five dimensions called axes that relate to different characteristics of disability or disorder the separate axes of the dsm are often linked together in the development of mental disorders the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems icd was created by the world health organization who and is the universal diagnostic system for mental disorders the icd is approved by health officials from who member countries and is available for free on the internet its purpose is to help countries reduce the problems associated with mental disorders the coding system used in the dsm is designed to be compatible with the system used in the icd however some codes may not match because the two publications get revised at different times the icd was made public in its most recent update occurred in chapter of the icd covers over mental and behavioral disorders which are divided into the following categories the online icd can be found in its entirety here psychoanalysis is a form of therapy based on psychoanalytic theory this theory states that human behavior is controlled by unconscious forces such as instinct and that there is no such thing as free will many ideas found in the psychoanalytic theory can be traced back to the famous psychologist sigmund freud freud believed mental disorders are a result of repressed memories and emotions from childhood psychoanalysis is designed to search for these hidden memories and emotions and bring them to the patient s attention techniques such as hypnosis are used to tap into the unconscious mind with the hopes that the source of the disturbance is found freud also believed dreams had hidden meanings and often asked patients to record their dreams for analysis because of the lack of scientific evidence supporting most freudian ideas psychoanalysis is rarely used by clinical psychologists and has been replaced by more effective forms of therapy behavior therapy is based on the theory of behaviorism which states that all human behavior is a result of a stimulus and reinforcement famous behaviorists include james watson b f skinner and joseph wolpe the goal of this therapy is to increase one s positive or socially reinforcing behavior behavior therapy can be broken down into three areas humanistic therapy is a method taken from carl rogers which aims to focus on a client as a human rather than the problem that they have a therapist can adjust the environment and mood of a session in a way that mimics normal conversation this often helps the patient realize the issues they have and share them with the therapist more successfully than in a traditional counseling session humanistic therapy creates an effective means of getting to the source of a problem and treating it properly roger s own term was client centered therapy which has the idea that the therapist is helping the client to become a genuine psychological adult", " the adaptive unconscious is a set of unconscious mental processes influencing judgment and decision making it is different from conscious processing it is faster effortless more focused on the present but less flexible it can be described as a quick sizing up of the world which interprets information and decides how to act very quickly and outside the conscious view in some theories of the mind the unconscious is limited to low level activity such as carrying out goals which have been decided consciously in contrast the adaptive unconscious is thought to be involved in high level cognition such as goal setting as well the term adaptive unconscious suggests it has survival value and hence is an adaptation which was strongly selected in the past indeed for much of vertebrate evolution all mental activity was unconscious no one supposes that fish have consciousness thus our consciousness is added to an already existing set of mechanisms which operate but whose operation is normally not felt by us p implicit or tacit learning is when a person learns without knowing it happens an important point made by reber is that implicit learning is a fundamental root process one that lies at the very heart of the adaptive behavioral repertoire of every complex organism what that means is that implicit learning is very much more ancient than the conscious type of learning that we as humans normally notice this is an expanding field of research the classic examples are the acquisition of language and the process of socialization children learn to speak their native language and become socialized to their society without being conscious of the principles which guide their behaviour there has been much debate on the bare existence of implicit learning because of the fact that knowledge gained is not verbalizable little research has been conducted on the requirements for the process of implicit learning to take place the evidence for there being such a thing as the adaptive unconscious is a series of case studies which are hard to explain any other way after many scientific tests were done on an early greek statue the getty museum was about to buy it however a small group of experts looked at it and said immediately it s a fake eventually it was found to be a fake the question was how could anyone beat the battery of scientific tests just by looking at it the sceptics were asked how they did it one said it doesn t look old as if it had been centuries under the ground another said its fingernails don t look right apparently they had all seen something which triggered a doubt psychologists thought this might be an ancient mental mechanism which has survival value a firefighter in cleveland answered a routine call with his men it was in a kitchen in the back of a one story house the firefighters broke down the door laid down their hose and began dousing the fire with water this had little effect as the fire lieutenant recalls he suddenly thought to himself there s something wrong here and he immediately ordered his men out moments after they fled the floor they had been standing on collapsed the fire had been in the basement not the kitchen as it appeared when asked how he knew to get out the fireman thought it was esp what is interesting is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out from the locked door in our brains the fireman just blinked and made the right decision in fact had he thought consciously about the situation he would probably have lost his life and the lives of his men p in a similar way there are people who can repeatedly do something which seems amazing it really is possible to spot who is lying for instance and it is a skill which can be trained and improved it is possible to predict which couple will divorce and which will not the time taken for each decision is short and to an observer the amount of information available to the person making the decision seems very little thin slice decisions based on limited information are one end of a scale at the other end is the confusion caused by too much unorganised information analysis paralysis there are many examples of the latter state being bad for decision taking a number of experiments have been done which strongly support the idea of an adaptive unconscious the basic idea is to bias the unconscious and see if it affects behaviour subjects sort out four word sentences from sets of five word they concentrate on getting the sentences right unknown to them the unused word gives their minds a subtle bias from one set with extra words florida old lonely forgetful wrinkle and some neutral words the experimental group walked more slowly away from the experimental room p the priming words had biased them to think elderly the idea is that of john bargh priming significantly affects test results a group being tested about the trivial pursuit game were split in two one group was first asked to think about what it would mean to be a professor they got of the questions right the other half were first asked to sit and think about soccer hooligans they scored other tests indicated that the two groups had similar mental ability the difference between the results is highly significant p another test was even more startling black college students were given questions from the graduate record examination a standard test used for entry to graduate schools in the u s a students were given a pretest questionnaire one group were asked to identify their race the other was not the first group scores were half that of the second group the experimenters later asked whether the question about their race affected them they all said no and added something like you know i just don t think i m smart enough to be here p of course this is of the greatest significance socially notice that once again the individuals did not notice consciously what had happened unconsciously the ventromedial area of the cerebral cortex is a small bit at front behind the nose neurologist antonio damasio studied patients who had damage to this area of the brain people with damage to this area are still rational and as intelligent as before but they lack judgement and find it very difficult to make decisions in fast moving situations the ability to make fairly good decisions rapidly is more important than making perfect decisions after lengthy thought it can be a matter of survival unconscious processes have a number of typical features which are quite different from the conscious processes obviously by definition unconscious processes are less available than conscious processes yet there is traffic between the two for example there is a well known tendency for all training to move from halting difficult conscious steps to smooth semi automatic performance that as anderson recognised is a shift from conscious to unconscious control as mastery is achieved anderson s key distinction is between declarative knowledge knowledge we are aware of and can talk about and procedural knowledge which guides action and decision making but which happens outside of conscious view learning also takes place in ways which are entirely unconscious to us at the time a classic example is the way children learn their native language between the ages of about months and four years they do not study language the way an older person does it happens automatically another example people under anaesthetic can hear and be influenced by what they hear access to memory also happens unconsciously even when we try to remember the actual process is unconscious it can happen entirely unconsciously an early experiment by korsakoff on patients with loss of conscious memory showed this he gave one patient mild electric shocks later when korsakoff returned the patient had forgotten all about it yet when he saw the apparatus the patient showed anxiety and accused him of wanting to give him an electric shock the experiment has been repeated since in various ways it is easy to show that our snap judgements can also be quite wrong especially when we are overwhelmed with information or when we come to the decisions with unconscious bias and prejudice in experiments subjects give verbal explanations of their own mental processes for example why they chose one thing rather than another as if they could directly introspect look inside the causes of their ideas and choices this introspection illusion may cause differences between the self and other people because people trust these unreliable introspections when forming attitudes about themselves but not about others", " addiction is when the body or mind badly wants or needs something in order to work right when you have addiction to something it is called being addicted or being an addict people can be addicted to drugs cigarettes alcohol caffeine and many other things when somebody is addicted to something they can become sick if they do not get the thing they are addicted to but taking more of the thing they are addicted to can also hurt their health some people who are addicts need to go to a doctor or hospital to cure the addiction so they no longer crave want or need the drug addiction takes place when the addictive element enters the body the blood stream moves the element around the body so that it gets to the brain and makes the person feel that they are enjoying it then they want more of that substance this takes place remarkably fast for some addictions such as hashish and cocaine but all of them control the consumer once under this control the consumer does not have a completely free will and listens to the addiction s bidding people can also be addicted to other things which are not drugs you may hear people talk about being addicted to the internet or addicted to chocolate or gambling this means that they get into a habit of enjoying that thing so if they have to go without it for a while they miss it a lot addiction is similar to a major disease like chronic heart disease or perhaps diabetes but addictions are not taken as seriously as these major diseases most people believe addiction to be a lifestyle choice which in fact it is but it is also part of a person s genetics while some people can do things and control themselves others cannot due to their genetic makeup there are ways of helping the addict but this takes the admission of a problem and then proper testing to reveal what kind of treatment is needed the american society of addiction medicine asam defines addiction as a treatable chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits genetics the environment and an individual s life experiences people with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences prevention efforts and treatment approaches for addiction are generally as successful as those for other chronic diseases  ", " an alter ego from latin other i is another self a second personality within a person it is also called leading a double life the term alter ego was first used in the th century it was inventory by psychologists in talking about dissociative identity disorder for example in the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde mr hyde was dr jekyll s evil alter ego same person different personalities the term is also used in popular fiction like comic books for the secret identity of a superhero vigilante or crimefighter the character would do this so people won t know that he or she is fighting crime examples of characters using alter egos include sometimes an artist uses an alter ego like", " the words anal retentive or anally retentive anal retentive often shortened to anal are used in everyday language to describe a person with so much attention to detail that the obsession becomes annoying to other people the idea was thought up by sigmund freud in the psychology ideas of freud the anal stage is said to follow the oral stage of development in babies and young kids this is usually when they are learning toilet training freud made a theory which said that children who experience troubles during this time may develop anal personality traits as well as a general interest in collecting and keeping things although freud s theories have been influential research suggests patterns of parental attitudes has a major effect on how a baby will grow up ", " the anal stage is the second stage in sigmund freud s psychosexual development theory freud believed the personality developed through several stages during childhood these stages focused on the erogenous zones the anal stage occurs between ages months to three years this is the period when a child toilet trains according to freud pleasure is derived from controlling the anus the primary erogenous zone and the bladder a toilet training conflict or fixation results in a rigid or disordered personality", " analytical psychology is the school of psychology that came from the ideas of swiss psychiatrist carl jung analytical psychology has two main parts ", " anger management is a psycho therapeutic program for anger control it has been described as using anger successfully ", " in psychology anhedonia greek an without h don pleasure is not being able to feel pleasure this may include not enjoying things like eating exercise watching movies meeting friends social activities or sexual interaction and activity in most cases anhedonia is caused by mental disorders it happens in some severe cases of depression and it is a common symptom of schizophrenia schizoid personality disorder and major depressive disorder", " anthropomorphism is suggesting that non human things have human traits emotions and intentions it is common for people to do this anthropomorphism is often used in stories and art the story of the three little pigs has a wolf and pigs who talk and act like humans mickey mouse also talks and acts like a human these are examples of a type of anthropomorphism called furry the novel the call of the wild also uses anthropomorphism the main character is a dog named buck many other characters are dogs and wolves in the story the animals think and act more like humans than real dogs do people can explain why they do things people are not as good at knowing why non human things do things this can lead to people assuming non human things will act or think like humans knowledge about humans is got early in life it is more detailed than knowledge about non human entities and is better remembered", " applied behavior analysis aba is a way to help organisms change their behavior and to identify the environmental contingencies that result in this behavior change aba the application of behavior analysis is based on the scientific approach known as radical behaviorism which views covert events as behavior that are to be subjected to the same conditions as overt behavior aba can be used as a treatment for animals mental disorders and developmental disabilities and is based on the principles of behavior that were discovered using experiments scientific experiments and articles about aba are published in the journal for applied behavior analysis jaba this journal was founded in in the first issue of jaba three people wrote an article explaining what applied behavior analysis is psychologists who study the way the environment influences behavior are called behaviorists they study the external causes of behavior instead of a person s feelings a person s feelings are internal so behaviorists think they cannot be studied scientifically psychologist john b watson founded behaviorism in and he is regarded as one of the first psychologists to study the applied science of behavior he thought that internal feelings should not be studied at all he also thought that behavior is shaped by the environment over time due to the outcome of a person s actions he believed all behavior is learned and can be changed if a person gets something good as a result of doing a behavior they are more likely to repeat that behavior if something bad happens as a result of a behavior a person is less likely to do that thing again this is an idea that is used a lot in aba one of the most famous behaviorists was the psychologist b f skinner skinner first published his ideas about behaviorism in he wrote a lot about behaviorism throughout his career he made some of the behavior principles that aba uses aba emerged when experimental behavior principles were applied to social behavior there are various people that began the process of applying these principles to social behavior one of the most famous was ole ivar lovaas in the s lovaas became one of the first people to use applied behavior analysis as a treatment for autism when lovaas began using aba to treat children with autism he changed the way developmental disorders were treated lovaas also thought that treatments would be more successful if they are started early in a child s life the idea of starting treatment with a child as soon as possible is called early intervention early intervention is still thought to be very important in aba one of the more recent developments in applied behavior analysis is the founding of the behavior analysis certification board bacb the bacb is a non profit corporation that was started in the bacb certifies behavior analysts in order to become a behavior analyst a person must go to a special school and then pass an exam once they pass this exam they will be board certified behavior analysts the bacb sets standards to make sure board certified behavior analysts bcbas are good at their jobs the bacb makes sure that the bcbas are using ethical legal and professional practices when they work there are seven characteristics of aba a treatment that is based on aba must have all of these things the following terms and ideas are used in applied behavior analysis it is important to understand these ideas when using aba based interventions in aba a behavior that is bad is called a problem behavior problem behavior is something that hurts the person doing it or hurts other people around them a problem behavior makes it harder for a person to learn new things positive reinforcement sr is when the addition of a stimulus leads to an increase in responding there are four different types of positive reinforcement negative reinforcement sr happens when the removal of a stimulus increases the likelihood a person will do a behavior in the future in this case the term negative does not mean bad the stimulus that is removed from the environment is something aversive this means that the person does not like it people will want to do a behavior if they know that something they do not like will be taken away reinforcements are given based on schedules of reinforcement the schedule will explain the ways reinforcement is earned behavior analysts decide which reinforcement schedule is best different schedules are useful for different things the schedule used depends on the person it also depends on the behavior that is being reinforced continuous reinforcement schedules crf reinforce a person every time they do the target behavior there are a few problems with crf schedules though the rates of behavior are not long lasting if the person stops being reinforced they may stop doing the target behavior another issue is satiation if the person becomes satiated it means that they do not want the reinforcer anymore these schedules of reinforcement only reinforce the target behavior sometimes the four most common types of intermittent schedules are a discriminative stimulus sd is something that tells a person that reinforcement is available the presentation of a sd should cause a response differential reinforcement teaches a person the difference between a sd and a non discriminative stimulus s delta a sd signals that reinforcement is available a s delta does not tell the person anything about the availability of reinforcement a s delta is not likely to produce responses because there is reinforcement is not given it is also used to decrease problem behavior there are four types of differential reinforcement that can be used to decrease a problem behavior extinction is a way to decrease rates of problem behavior a dra program should be used at the same time as an extinction program this will make the extinction program more effective reinforcement is always the first thing that is tried when trying to change a behavior reinforcement produces long lasting results and is better for the person however reinforcement does not always reduce problem behavior if reinforcement does not work it may be necessary to try punishment punishment is effective but it can have bad consequences it can cause emotional harm if it is not used correctly punishment is any response to a behavior that decreases the likelihood of a behavior happening in the future punishment of a problem behavior should be used with reinforcement of the appropriate behavior appropriate behavior should always be reinforced even when using punishment for problem behavior just like reinforcement punishment can be both positive and negative positive punishment is the addition of an stimulus that decreases the chances of future responses this stimulus that is added is something aversive negative punishment is the removal of a stimulus that decreases the chance of future behaviors happening the stimulus that is removed is something that the person likes prompting increases the likelihood that a behavior will be done the right way using prompts will make the learning process easier and quicker someone that is teaching a new behavior can use prompts to help the person that is learning the behavior the two broad categories of prompts are stimulus and response examples of stimulus prompts would be lists or pictures that help the learner remember what the correct response is response prompts do not involve a change in the antecedent there are three types of response prompts fading prompts is a way to increase the independence of the learner once the learner can do the behavior on their own they will not need the help of the teacher however if a teacher stops using prompts quickly it may confuse the learner so prompts should be decreased slowly the process of gradually decreasing prompting is called fading shaping is a way to teach new behaviors or improve behaviors that have already been taught it involves reinforcing steps towards a target behavior complex behaviors are made up of smaller simple behaviors this is what the concept of behavior chains is based on a behavior chain is when smaller behaviors are combined to form a complex behavior these smaller behaviors are done in a certain order each of the smaller behaviors is a step in the behavior chain each step in a behavior chain is a response on its own there are three different ways to teach a behavior chain aba relies on data to make decisions about behavior behavior analysts are always collecting data about a person s behavior direct observation is when behavior is watched and recorded indirect measures compare one person s behavior to other people s behavior an example would be an intelligence test one person s score is compared to the scores that other people got there are three common methods of data collection they are frequency interval and time sampling these methods are used for direct observation a functional analysis fa is done to find the reason for problem behavior the reason for problem behavior must be known before a behavioral intervention can be done behavior analysts came up with the idea of a functional analysis in since then it has become an important part of aba the behavior analyst is tries to find the situations that cause the highest rates of problem behavior the situations that cause the highest rates of problem behavior tell the behavior analyst the reason for the behavior once the reasons for problem behavior are known treatment can begin treatments based on the results of a fa are more effective than without a fa applied behavior analysis is commonly associated with autism this is because aba is the only treatment for autism that has been scientifically proven to be effective", " in psychology an archetype is a model of a person personality or behavior in the analysis of personality the term archetype is often broadly used to refer to but in a strict linguistic sense an archetype is merely a defining example of a personality type in this sense mother figure can be considered an archetype and instances can be found in various female characters with distinct personalities archetypes have been present in mythology and literature for hundreds of years the use of archetypes to analyze personality was advanced by carl jung early in the th century the value in using archetypal characters in fiction derives from the fact that a large group of people are able to unconsciously recognize the archetype and thus the motivations behind the character s behavior the word archetype appeared in european texts as early as it derives from the latin noun archetypum via the greek noun arkhetypon and adjective arkhetypos meaning first moulded the greek roots are arkhe first or original typos model type blow mark of a blow", " the assault on truth freud s suppression of the seduction theory is a book published in by psychoanalyst and historian jeffrey masson in the book masson criticizes austrian neurologist a person who treats the nervous system sigmund freud for abandoning the seduction theory which held that neurotic illness in adults and adolescents was a result of their being sexually abused before puberty freud said that his patients confabulated the molestations and then rejected this theory masson says that freud s original view was the correct one ", " autism is the name of a disorder affecting brain development it is one of a group of disorders called autism spectrum disorder asd asperger syndrome atypical autism and childhood autism are kinds of autism spectrum disorders asd is a condition that affects the way a person relates to their environment the word spectrum is used because not all people with autism have the same traits and difficulties some people find interacting more difficult than others autism may be very apparent in someone or they may show no outward signs of it the main areas of difficulty are in social interaction verbal and nonverbal communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests in most cases of autism motor communication doing things is affected all these signs develop in the child s first two to three years of age people who have autism find it difficult to act in a way that other people think is normal they may find it difficult to talk to other people and to look at other people in the eyes some people with autism do not like being touched a person who has autism can seem to be turned inwards they may talk only to themselves rock themselves backwards and forwards and laugh at their own thoughts they might not like any type of change and may find it very difficult to learn a new behavior like going to school autism is caused by the way that the brain develops both before and after a baby is born about one in every children has an autism spectrum disorder it has no known cure and many autistic people do not want a cure they want it to be accepted as a difference this is known as neurodiversity the word autism comes from the greek word autos meaning self the term describes conditions in which a person is removed from social interaction hence an isolated self the term autism was first used by a psychiatrist named eugen bleuler in to describe one group of symptoms of schizophrenia sigmund freud considered this idea and thought it was related to narcissism three decades later researchers in the united states began to use the term autism to describe children with emotional or social problems two researchers by the name of hans asperger and leo kanner were the pioneers of the research study for autism in the s in leo kanner a doctor from johns hopkins university did a study of children he found out that they had difficulties such as changing environments being sensitive to certain stimuli having speech problems and allergies to food later he named the children s condition early infantile autism now called autism in hans asperger studied separately a group of children and found very similar conditions the children in hans asperger s group did not repeat words and they had no speech problems like kanner s did however the children did have problems with fine motor skills such as holding a pencil the children he studied seemed to be clumsier than other children they also had a lack of empathy little ability to form friendships one sided conversation intense absorption in a special interest and clumsy movements hans asperger described a milder form of autism his discovery is now called asperger syndrome in and kanner described the children he studied in scientific papers in these papers he wrote that he thought the children s parents were not loving them enough he wrote that this might be part of the reason why the children had autism for example in he wrote that the children s parents showed no warmth or love to their children he thought the parents were so cold that he compared them to refrigerators the children were left neatly in refrigerators which did not defrost their withdrawal seems to be an act of turning away from such a situation to seek comfort in solitude this idea became known as the refrigerator mother theory for decades parents were blamed for causing their children s autism by not loving their children enough by now we know this is not true schizophrenia and autism were linked in many researchers studies only since the s medical professionals began to have a separate understanding of these two disorders since kanner s so called early infantile autism is listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm precisely because of the vague distinction between schizophrenia and autism the dsm came out with a more accurate definition of autism in henceforth early infantile autism is called autism disorder furthermore for the first time the dsm introduced standardized criteria to diagnose autism the fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders expanded the definition of autism and included milder cases of autism but especially the asperger s syndrome was added in with the release of the fifth edition of the dsm in the subtypes of autism are summarized into the general term autism spectrum disorder asd individuals are now diagnosed on an autism spectrum with varying levels of intensity mild moderate and severe different studies resulted in different numbers of the frequency of autism spectrum disorders one study stated ten cases of classical autism cases of asperger s syndrome and cases of mild autism pdd nos in people tendency increasing other sources speak about autism spectrum disorder cases in people however the number of autism cases is not equal in men and in women here the results of studies vary highly researchers in general say that men are diagnosed for every woman that is diagnosed this ratio decreases for severe cases to it increases for high functioning cases and in asperger s syndrome reaches a ratio of recently the awareness has increased that this ratio may be so high because studies are simply missing female autistic people this could be because tests for autism typically focus on male autism traits another possible explanation is that autistic females may be better at adapting to social expectations and hiding their social problems studies have suggested that the brains of autistic females may rather be like neurotypical men s non autistic men brains of the same age these could be reasons why it is not so easy to realise whether a woman is autistic and therefore why more men than women are diagnosed over the past years individuals have been using the terms autism and autism spectrum disorder like they mean the same thing autism is a spectrum disorder this means that some people who have autism are only mildly affected these people may go to regular schools go to work and have partners and families some people are affected worse than others these people may be able to take care of most of their own needs at home like dressing and getting food but not be able to have a regular job or travel alone a person who has severe autism may need to be cared for all their life few people with autism are extraordinarily gifted or talented these people are said to have savant syndrome they are often very good at just one thing in particular like mathematics playing the piano or remembering football scores the overall category of the autism spectrum disorder is called pervasive developmental disorder the name describes medical conditions with developmental problems in a number of fields in most cases when referring to the autism spectrum disorder we are referring to the most common disorders additionally only one or two of the three categories social interaction communication and behaviour are affected the different categories the so called international classification of diseases icd are defined by the world health organization as shown in the table the diseases vary in several points these are the age of onset social interaction communication and behaviour an individual belongs to a certain category depending on the areas of impairment all three may seem similar in symptoms yet are not the same still people within one group show similar symptoms the groups can be used to search for an underlying cause of the disease and to provide a better treatment scientists do not know exactly what causes autism there may be many different causes for the different types of autism spectrum disorder scientists do know about some things that make a person more likely to have an autism spectrum disorder the autism spectrum disorders are highly heritable disorders this means that it is very likely over that the child of an autistic person will also be on the autism spectrum the reason for this are certain genes these genes are linked to autism and are passed on from a parent to the child already leo kanner and hans asperger noticed that fathers of autistic children often preferred being on their own over being with people therefore kanner and asperger suspected a genetic cause studies with families with a child on the autism spectrum were done to investigate this theory they found that sometimes the children s parents fathers as well as mothers also show social difficulties shyness and problems with understanding contextual information when talking to someone some studies have found this in only out of families some in as much as out of every families other than the studies done on children who had autistic parents recently a couple of studies were done on children who either had a sibling or a twin showing autistic signs similar to the outcomes in the autistic parents studies most children having autistic siblings twins were found out to be showing autistic signs according to a recent study around fifty percent of infants with autistic siblings showed some kind of atypical behaviour around one forth of them showed delays and deficits in achieving infancy milestones and around of all were later diagnosed with asd autism spectrum disorder moreover twin studies showed that it is much more likely that identical twins are both on the autism spectrum than that non identical twins are both on the autism spectrum identical twins have nearly the same dna therefore it is highly probable that they are either both autistic or both not autistic non identical twins share only half of their genes which makes it less likely that they both have the disorder scientists have shown that the recurrence risk the likelihood that a child is on the autism spectrum if it has a sister or a brother that is autistic as well is to times higher than the probability for having the disorder in the average population however it is not a single gene that increases the risk for autism spectrum disorders several genes have been linked to the disorder all of the identified genes can in sum only explain one or two out of every ten autism cases none of the genes that have been found to play a role in autism can explain more than one out of every cases the genetic influences include the affected genes influence researchers have not found a single neuronal correlate for autism spectrum disorders i e no abnormal functioning of the brain is the only cause of autism nevertheless scientists found some differences between the brains of autistic people and the typical human brain these differences lie in the anatomy of the brain the activity in certain brain regions as well as in the connections between brain regions it is a general tendency that autistic people use the same brain regions as other people but show different activity in some areas the activity is less in others it is stronger however this may only be true for male autists throughout the last years studies have shown that brains of autistic women might be like normal men s brains some researchers grouped autistic people s difficulties into three main areas in order to investigate their neuronal basis researchers say that building a theory of mind is one of the main problems for autistic people this makes it difficult for them to interact with others problems in social interaction are probably worsened by low preference for social stimuli such as faces this tendency has been found in studies tracking the person s eye movements and in eeg studies eeg studies showed lower than normal activity in the fusiform face area ffa a brain region that is usually active when seeing faces however the results of other studies could not show this also scientists measured brain activity of people on the autism spectrum with fmri while they were thinking about their own emotions they found activity in the same brain regions as in non autistic people the difference was that some regions which are important for thinking about oneself and emotions especially the anterior insula were less active in autistic people other brain regions were much more active these findings may explain the difficulties people with autism experience when trying to understand complex facial expressions and emotions such as shame jealousy people on the autism spectrum show a lower ability for executive function executive function means physical emotional and cognitive self control this includes planning actions focusing shifting attention and flexibility of behaviour and thinking autistic people s ability can improve but it will remain below non autistic people s ability in executive function problems with executive function are probably caused by large networks in the brain grey matter and white matter irregularities have a negative influence on the way different brain regions work together functional integration a smaller corpus callosum leads to abnormalities in working memory an active process of keeping a memory until it is needed and planning actions central coherence is the ability to build wholes out of parts it is weak in people with autism this means that autistic people focus more on details they cannot build wholes out of them not being able to pay attention to wholes results in difficulties with perception and language therefore people with autism usually need more time for dealing with information coming from their surroundings as a consequence they typically also need more time for responding however performance varies between people on the autism spectrum moreover the term central coherence may include many interacting aspects this makes it difficult to find the cause for it in the brain neural correlates for central coherence are not yet known the risk for autism spectrum disorders can be increased if the mother uses thalidomide valproic acid or drinks too much alcohol during pregnancy the risk for autism also increases with the age of father and mother at the time of pregnancy scientists know that parents do not cause their children s autism by not being loving enough scientists do know for sure that vaccines do not cause autism vaccines do not even make a person more likely to have autism even if they are already at a high risk for autism before they get their vaccines in a wakefield and others found autism signs one month after the measles mumps rubella mmr vaccine was applied they released a paper in which they claimed that autism is caused by the mmr vaccine however the study had several flaws also no plausible biological mechanism could explain how the mmr vaccine leads to autism since then many case control studies have been done to investigate the relationship between vaccines and autism this means they compared a group which was vaccinated with a group that was not vaccinated but apart from that identical they did not find mmr vaccines to be the cause of autism neither did they find an increased risk for autism by the vaccination parents also worried that thiomersal us thimerosal a substance that makes vaccines and other medicines usable for a longer time might cause autism because it contains mercury no harm from the amount of ethylmercury in vaccines was known yet vaccines for infants containing mercury were taken from the market nevertheless thiomersal as a cause for autism is biologically also not biologically mercury poisoning triggers clearly different symptoms than autism still researchers did studies about this topic they did not find a connection between thiomersal and autism finally a third theory was suggested it was stated that many vaccines at the same time would weaken the immune system of infants however autism is not a disorder that is related to the immune system furthermore single and also many vaccines do not weaken the immune system diagnosing autism is difficult since there is no medical test like a blood test instead an evaluation is made by a team of doctors and other health professionals who are experienced in autism and know the individual a reliable diagnosis can first be given at the age of two at the age of and months children should get a check up if anything wrong is noticed a further evaluation is done in this a team of professionals will interview the child s guardians about the child s behaviour and see what they are like in different settings this may also include behavioural or physical assessments as well as intelligence tests or developmental tests a good detailed history of the child is often very useful in receiving a diagnosis adults can be diagnosed in adults as well as children this can be difficult because autism has symptoms that can overlap with other disorders such as ocd that may have appeared by adulthood an expert will usually ask the adult about concerns challenges in life such as socially or behaviourally as well as standardised testing in these areas they also often ask for a developmental history in the american psychiatric association published the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm v in order to be diagnosed with autism a person must fulfill two standardized criteria it is important that individuals must show symptoms from early childhood even if those symptoms are recognized later these symptoms have to limit everyday functioning additionally these symptoms cannot be explained by an intellectual disability or a developmental delay autism spectrum disorder is characterized by difficulties in social interaction verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviours autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of symptoms skills and levels of disability some autistic people also have learning disabilities mental health issues or other conditions this means that autism can also co occur with other conditions and symptoms of the following disorders in the dsm v a diagnosis of autism excludes making a formal diagnosis of other psychiatric disorders therefore other mental health conditions may be undiagnosed in an autistic person because it is impossible to make a comorbid clinical diagnosis since autism is a spectrum every person with autism is different different treatments help different people there are a few different categories of treatment the main ones are medication different therapies and diets the treatment is fitted depending on what a person with autism needs it is still unclear what causes autism there may be a few causes at the moment it is only possible to lower the symptoms of autism a full recovery from autism is not possible if therapies cannot reduce the symptoms of autism medications are used additionally often several medications are used at the same time to treat different symptoms of autism serotonin is a chemical messenger that transports signals between cells and is very important for normal function such as with sensory perception memory learning and sleep all of which are impaired in autistic people researchers have not yet found a link between autism and serotonin although they have been successful in treating autism with ssris which stop cells from absorbing serotonin meaning more is used for signals they can be used to treat repetitive behaviour aggression hyperactive behaviour and outbursts of anger the ssris can have many side effects usually the medication is better tolerated by adults than by children examples of ssris are clomipramine fluvoxamine sertraline venlafaxine trazodone and mirtazapine dopamine is a chemical messenger in the brain it helps to do movements release hormones and strengthen cognitive abilities researchers found that increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain will worsen the symptoms of autism substances that help to reduce symptoms of autism are the antipsychotic drugs there are two types of antipsychotic medications one of the types are typical antipsychotics they block the sites where dopamine would bind to a cell atypical antipsychotic drugs on the other hand block the sites where dopamine or serotonin would bind to a cell antipsychotic medicine is the most successful treatment for excitability in autism it can also help to reduce aggression self injury hyperactivity and repetitive although it may have many side effects originally antipsychotic medications were used to treat mental disorders like depression bipolar disorder or schizophrenia examples of antipsychotic drugs are haloperidol clozapine risperidone and paliperidone in the beginning psychostimulants were only used for patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder researchers found out that they can also help patients with autism the medication can reduce hyperactivity and inattention in people with autism the medication can have many side effects examples are methylphenidate clonidine and guanfacine people with autism often have problems with their digestive organs like the stomach or gut these problems could be inflammations abdominal pain gas diarrhea or bacterial overgrowth the reasons may be malnutrition food intolerances or allergies specific food products causing these problems are excluded from the diet in many cases products containing gluten or casein the main protein occurring in dairy products are excluded in many cases vitamins minerals as well as essential fatty acids are additionally provided a big problem is that many autistic people cannot tell that they have pain therefore many problems concerning the digestive organs stay undetected therapy can be used to minimize distress caused by sensory overload individual therapy plans are created the therapist tries to help the autistic person in many different aspects one part of this is sensory integration the therapist will help the patient to make sense of different sensory inputs for example they may ask a child patient to play with finger paints or collect objects from a bad of dried beans another part is the training of daily life activities the therapist may help the patient to get used to things like getting dressed eating hygiene shopping and financial management these may be done one step at a time if the activity involves multiple steps such as cooking play therapy is also helpful especially for children it can be useful to learn about certain emotions which can be hard for autistic people this can also be used to help learn social conventions such as shaking hands instead of hugging when meeting a stranger often animals are used to help autistic people most often dogs or horses are used the people diagnosed with autism can care for these animals pet them and in the case of the horse even ride on them studies showed that the interaction between an autistic person and animals can increase communication reduce stress fear aggression and reduce the severity of the symptoms of autism music therapy consists of two parts one is an active listening part here the therapist is making music himself or playing music from a record in the other part the autistic person can make music himself like playing an instrument or singing music therapy will improve different aspects of communication here different materials and techniques are used to draw pictures the aim of art therapy is to make the autistic person more flexible and relaxed and to improve communication skills self image and learning skills the effects of the therapy can be long lasting and transferred to the school work or home setting these are just little workouts for the left and right hemisphere based on whether your child is having left or right brain weakness bear crawls help develop body awareness improve coordination and motor planning and build strength in the trunk and upper body throwing weighted objects like medicine balls can increase core strength and balance and help improve coordination it may also have therapeutic benefits and can stimulate brain centers responsible for short term memory in a study published in research in autism spectrum disorders the authors found that movements similar to those exhibited by those with autism may help provide needed feedback to the body this may reduce repetitive behaviors such as arm flapping or clapping arm circles are a great upper body exercise that helps increase flexibility and strength in the shoulders and back and can be done anywhere with no equipment scientific studies", " autogenic training is a relaxation technique developed by the german psychiatrist johannes schultz and first published in the technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around minutes usually in the morning at lunch time and in the evening during each session the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures e g lying down sitting meditation sitting like a rag doll etc schultz emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation however unlike some forms of yoga and meditation autogenic training is devoid of any mysticism it is a method for influencing one s autonomic nervous system autogenic training is counter indicated or needs to be adapted for a series of conditions including heart problems such as myocardial infarction diabetes psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia glaucoma alcohol or drug abuse epilepsy", " automatic behaviour is the name for a set of actions that occur or that continue to occur without conscious thought usually they are guided by a part of the nervous system that is called autonomic nervous system or visceral nervous system automatic behaviour is like a reflex many mental illnesses have certain forms of unwanted automatic behaviour ", " there have been several classifications of the needs of a person while these classifications vary they commonly place the basic needs at the lowest level basic needs are those that must be satisfied to guarantee survival according to abraham maslow these include maslow doesn t clearly say which of these are basic needs absolute

to look at it hear it feel it taste it smell it or think about it it is also the name of a feeling that is hard to describe the nature of this feeling varies from person to person and culture to culture it is not known if only humans can feel it there are many ideas about what beauty is some people say that beauty is there are many other theories some things that people say are beautiful are not explained by any of these ideas", " behaviourism is an approach to study behaviour based only on what can be directly seen behaviorists focus on relationships between stimuli and responses unseen qualities such as states of mind any condition which is significantly different from a normal waking state e g as a result of fear or anxiety were not used in this type of study even though we know that the mind plays a part in all advanced animals behaviors behaviourism states that behaviour can be studied without knowing what the physiology of an event is and without using theories such as that of the mind by definition all behaviour can be observed behaviorism also relied on another idea that all human behaviour was learned behaviorists believed that behavior could be explained by classical or operant conditioning this is learning as a result of influences from past experiences however behaviourists denied the importance of inherited behaviours instincts inherent inclination of a living organism or inherited tendency to behave they did not believe or ignored the idea of heredity passing of traits to offspring from parents that something can come from a person s genes this was the idea of the blank slate that babies are born with a clean empty mind humans when born are thought not to have mental experience or knowledge and that everything is learned after they grow the blank slate premise is opposed by modern evolutionary psychology major contributors scientists to the field of behaviorism include c lloyd morgan ivan pavlov edward thorndike john b watson and b f skinner pavlov researched classical conditioning through the use of dogs and their natural ability to salivate produce water in their mouths thorndike and watson rejected looking at one s own conscious thoughts and feelings introspection they wanted to restrict psychology to experimental methods skinner s research leant mainly on behaviour shaping using positive reinforcement rewards rather than punishments today ideas from behaviourism are used in cognitive behavioral therapy cognitive behavioral therapy can help people deal with anxieties and phobias as well as with certain forms of addiction as a scientific theory behaviourism has largely been replaced by cognitive psychology the act of conditioning is when a desired behavior is made through training this is done by pairing stimuli with a specific behavior some behaviors are natural reflexes which people and animals are born with infants are born with inherited reflexes that help them eat communicate and survive these reflexes are unconditioned they are not taught to the baby classical conditioning also known as pavlovian conditioning is when a conditioned stimulus causes an unconditioned response this explains how people gained new responses to different stimuli another example of an unconditioned response is when wind is blown in a person s eyes and they blink automatically to prevent dust or something from getting into them this is a reflex that is innate fear conditioning is when a previously neutral stimulus is used to elicit fear one main example is the little albert experiment by watson and rayner the researchers tested infants emotional reactions they found that little albert would react to a loud noise and then consequently conditioned that noise to elicit fear when he saw a white rat this came to be known as conditioned emotional response after a period of time little albert would cry when he saw a white rat or anything small and white even his stuffed animal operant conditioning is also known as instrumental conditioning it was studied by thorndike and skinner", " behaviour or behavior is what an animal does or how it acts behaviours may be conscious or unconscious they may be inherited or learnt the term is also used for systems and for machines which interact with their environment the term is not well defined in experiments behaviour is the observed reaction which occurs when an organism is given a stimulus some organisms are more complicated than others and may be more aware of their surroundings if their behaviour is conscious it means that they know what they are doing if they are not aware of what they are doing this is unconscious behaviour humans will pull their hand back without thinking if they accidentally touch something hot this is done because we and other animals inherit nervous system reflexes which cause us to pull away from the thing that is causing the pain behaviour is linked to the nervous system as well as the endocrine system the nervous system reacts and notices what happens the hormone system is much slower it makes some kinds of behaviour more or less likely a simple example is the change from being a child to an adult this involves a whole range of hormones which affect growth and behaviour behaviour is also linked to learning organisms which are more complicated can learn better than those that are simpler however even the simplest animals show habituation which is a primitive kind of learning for organisms learning means that they change their behaviour because they remember having been in that situation before and know how to react people often use the word behaviour to mean the way people interact with behave towards one another children are taught what is good behaviour and what is bad behaviour good behaviour is about being polite and thoughtful to other people it is the kind of behaviour that people in a society expect from others", " bias means that a person prefers an idea and possibly does not give equal chance to a different idea bias can be influenced by a number of factors such as popularity for example a newspaper might be biased towards a particular political party due to their employees sharing the same political beliefs as that party bias in an article or editorial would show one point of view using selected facts and quotes to support that point of view facts or opinions that do not support the point of view in a biased article would be excluded for example an article biased toward riding a motorcycle would show facts about the good gas mileage fun and agility an article biased against motorcycle riding would show facts about risk of injury and noise and ignore positive facts about motorcycles an article biased against guns would show only facts and information that support the author s position they would list suicides accidental shootings and other facts showing guns in a negative way an article biased for guns should show only information that supports the author s position the positively biased article would discuss lives saved by guns numbers of crimes prevented by civilian gun use and other facts and data that put gun ownership and guns in a good light bias in writing can also be shown by using bad or slang words to refer to groups of people or things broads rather than women murdercycles rather than motorcycles words or phrasing that make wide assumptions about races or groups of people also indicates bias all chinese people are good at math bias also means mistakes in measurements for example a person may measure the height of another person wearing shoes the shoes make the height more than the same person without shoes if the extra height of the shoes extra bias was not explained someone might think that the person had been measured without shoes on data with extra parts not explained is called biased data", " for the book see here blank slate or tabula rasa which means the same thing was a philosophical idea of john locke it had like much of philosophy a history which went as far back as aristotle but it was locke who made it known to our modern world humans when born are thought not have mental experience or knowledge and that everything is learned after they grow in particular locke thought all knowledge came from sense data and the mind is empty at the beginning by sense data is meant the process of hearing seeing touching etc locke s idea was immediately picked up by others many have held similar views the founder of behaviourism john b watson throughout the th century the influence of evolution and genetics ran against these liberal ideas ethology proved that much animal behaviour was inherited instinctual innate and permanent konrad lorenz argued that the aggression so obvious in the history of mankind was a playing out of behaviour which had evolutionary advantage in our past the field of evolutionary psychology set out to examine the role played by evolution on our mental life if humans share a common evolutionary history with the other animals it is likely that we inherit mental traits from our evolution the human ability to learn a language is inherited and is of huge practical importance very important also though less obvious is the way that our unconscious mind helps us get through life the apparatus which performs that mental activity is certainly inherited these are some reasons why a number of recent publications have rejected locke s idea", " body positivity is a social movement that believes that people should have a positive body image the

bully other people are called bullies anybody can be bullied even a group of people there are many different kinds of bullying bullying does not always mean hitting people it can also be things that people say bullying includes when people see what happens but they don t do anything about it when people who see bullying know what to do and they do it they can help make a bad situation better it s also bullying when other people hide it from those who can help teachers bosses when other people see it but ignore it or when a person helps the bully to do it without getting in trouble school teachers and staff have tried to learn ways to stop bullying however bullying can be easy to hide some us states have laws against it bullying can happen almost anywhere this includes at school at work at home and on the internet cyber bullying a goal is part of what makes bullying what it is there are many goals that bullies can have including bullying may be a mix of some of these tactics ways of doing something for example lance armstrong said yes i was a bully i was a bully in the sense that i tried to control the narrative and if i didn t like what someone said i turned on them in other words when someone said something that armstrong didn t like he ran them over and bullied them bullying also includes using power or position the wrong way this can mean making comments or threats about losing a job the person that is getting bullied then feels insecure not sure about themselves bullying also includes moving the goalposts by setting goals which subtly change in ways that cannot be reached bullying happens for a reason most of the time the person is either not getting the attention they want or they are going through problems and want to control someone else another reason that could explain it is that the person does not feel good about themselves so they bully others to make themselves feel stronger therefore when the person wants to get attention and make others believe they are the best they may start saying mean things to other people or starting fights many people do not know how to deal with bullying in school the first thing one should do is to tell an adult that they trust someone who is bullied may want to keep friends around if a bully comes to you try to stay calm and get away safely some charities groups made to help people are made to fight bullying and to help the people who are bullied there are also laws against bullying in the uk such as section of the education and inspections act ", " the carrot and stick refers methods of

happen in humans between birth and the end of adolescence at which time the individual goes from dependence to independence the development is strongly influenced by genetic mental physical and social factors that may happen during the progression children develop at different levels in particular children having autism spectrum troubles or down syndrome may have different development than usual or substandard motor development ideas about how children develop psychologically have changed over time there are several important theories on how children develop during this time children were seen as separate than adults children under or were different than other people and treated as children even teenagers were not fully grown religious writings sometimes talked about children as evil and needing to be pure they also sometimes talked about them as good and angels at the time of the reformation children were thought to be born evil adults thought children needed to be taught to be a person children had to wear tight and uncomfortable clothes raising a child was thought to be one of the most important things adults wanted children to use reason in learning in the time of the enlightenment people started to think differently about children and development people respected children more and treated them better two important people had ideas about children during the enlightenment they were john locke and jean jacques rousseau john locke thought that children were born without any knowledge he thought the mind is tabula rasa or blank slate this means that the mind is like a blank piece of paper when someone is born children get knowledge in life and fill up the blank paper locke thought that the only way that children get knowledge is from doing different things in life and getting experience from those things locke s ideas on how children get knowledge changed how people thought about children his belief was that learning should be fun rather than a task children should be free to be childish wrote locke locke s ideas were opposed to church principles strictly believing children should be reading fables and not religious texts children were seen in a better way and got more respect from adults locke wanted parents to spend more time with their children and help them learn he thought that children s development of knowledge needed parents to help children experience new things and teach about those things locke pushed nurture as the most important part of child development jean jacques rousseau had a different idea than locke on children he thought that children are born knowing what is right and wrong rousseau did not think that children are blank slates as locke did he thought that children are noble savages this is the idea that children are born good but society can make them bad rousseau felt that adults should pay attention to children s needs during their different stages of development sigmund freud was a neurologist an psychoanalyst who tried to help adults with their troubles he talked with adults about when they were children and anything that happened during that time freud focused on the unconscious mind this is the part of the mind that a person is not able to know about directly freud thought that the unconscious mind was important in how people think and feel the way people think and feel can affect how they act freud s ideas lead him to make his psychosexual theory the psychosexual theory focuses on how a child s wants are controlled in early years and the effect it has when the child becomes an adult freud thought that each person s personality is made of three parts the parts are the id ego and super ego the three parts each have a purpose but are almost never in agreement the three parts not in agreement is what causes people to be unhappy and have problems when a baby is born it only has basic needs the baby needs to eat sleep and use the bathroom these basic needs help the baby to live these basic needs are what make up the id the id only wants to take cause of these needs the id wants the needs to be taken care of right away and not have to wait freud thought that young children are ruled by the id the id does not know or care about right and wrong it only wants to take care of its needs this means that young children do not know about right and wrong they only know what the id wants children will act on the wants of the id even when they should not children begin to learn that they cannot always get what they want when they want it this causes the ego to form the ego is ruled by the reality principle this means that it knows what can really happen in the world the ego knows if the id can get what it wants by looking at if the want can be filled when the id s needs cannot be taken care of the ego controls the id and its wants children that have the ego formed can control their basic needs and their actions when the ego is formed children gain a sense of self by controlling their needs the superego is formed by children working with their parents and others in society the superego acts as a rule follower it allows the child to know what is right and wrong by what society s rules on right and wrong are guilt is the primary way that the superego tells children the rules of what is right and wrong freud thought that children went through five psychosexual stages of development in the stages children have to fix problems between needs and what society wants fixing these problems allows children to do well as adults problems that adults get have to do with the stage where they had trouble with the five stages are oral anal phallic latency and genital the oral stage begins at birth and has to do with the baby s suckling needs the anal stage is the second and is from year olds it has to do with holding and letting go of urine and feces the third stage the phallic stage is from year olds and has to do with the genital region freud thought that this stage is one of the most important stages to fix problems in if a child does not fix the problems he or she can develop either the oedipus complex for boys or the electra complex for girls these problems come from love either a boy s love for his mother or a girl s love for her father to stop problems the boy or girl take up the values of their father for boys or mother for girls the fourth stage of the psychosexual stages is the latency stage and it occurs from year olds in this stage the superego grows the most and children get values from society the last stage is the genital stage and lasts through adolescence in this stage children start to like others and form heterosexual relationships freud s theory of child development is important because it was the first to point out the importance of parent child relationships erik erikson was a follower of freud s ideas and started his own theory using freud s ideas erikson s theory is called the psychosocial theory of child development erikson used freud s idea of the id ego and superego and his stages of development to build his own theory erikson thought that the ego was of the utmost importance the ego was important because it lets children become an individual and add to society erikson added more stages to his theory than freud did and some of his stages are similar to freud s erikson ended up with eight stages in his theory every stage has a problem between two different feelings a child s personality is shaped by how they fix each problem erkison s stages erikson s stages are important because they looked at society and culture and how they affect personality freud only focused on sexuality erkison s stages are also show how personality is shaped as children grow erikson s vs freud s stages john watson did not like the psychoanalytic theories of freud and erikson watson chose to look at behavior of people to understand how children develop his ideas fall under the concept of behaviorism watson was inspired by pavlov s studies of animal learning pavlov s studies focused on classical conditioning classical conditioning is when an animal or person learns to react to stimulus a thing that will cause a reaction watson thought that children could be taught using this way watson decided to test his theory by doing an experiment using a nine month old baby little albert watson started his experiment by testing if albert was scared of anything watson wanted to see if albert was scared of a white rat like most babies albert was not scared of the white rat watson wanted to test if he could make albert scared using classical conditioning watson discovered that albert was scared of the sound of a hammer hitting a steel gong with a hammer when albert was eleven months old watson went on with the experiment albert was given the white rat a few seconds later watson made the hammer hit the gong albert cried when this happened this was done seven times after the seven times albert would cry when he saw the white rat little albert also became scared of other things called generalization these things had a similarity to the white rat they were a rabbit a dog a fur coat a santa claus mask and watson s hair watson s experiment was important because he was able to teach albert to be scared of something watson showed that children can be taught through classical conditioning after the experiment watson thought that children are affected by the environment albert bandura felt that children learn by watching others in society after watching children then copy what was done his theory is called social learning theory the copying that children perform is called modeling the person that children copy is called the model bandura thought there are four conditions needed for modeling to happen children are likely to model behavior if the model is of the same sex a girl child will copy a woman model better than a man this is because the child wants to act like people she is like also children are more likely to model behavior if the behavior gets positive reactions from adults when children are praised they will keep doing the behavior they do this because they want to get more praise a child will not always get praise for their behaviors instead they might get punishment if a child gets punishment for a behavior they will not model it a child can also chose to model behavior or not by watching what happens to the model if the model gets punishment the child will not model the behavior this is because the child does not want to get punishment bandura did an experiment to test his ideas the experiment is known as the bobo doll experiment bandura took boys and girls for his experiment the children were between and years old he also used one man and one woman model bandura wanted to see if the children would model aggressive or mean behavior bandura broke the children into eight groups of and one group of the groups were made by breaking half of the children into an aggressive group and half into one that was not the two groups were both broken in half again by boys and girls bandura then split the girls into two groups one group had the woman model and the other had the man model he did the same with the boys the group of had no model the children were put in a play room with the model the children were told to sit on a chair and the model went to the other side of the room the children that were in aggressive groups saw the model go up the a bobo doll in the room and play with it the model spent most of the time being aggressive to the doll the children that were not in the aggressive group saw the model play with tinker toys and not pay attention to the bobo doll the model then left the room the children were allowed to play with the toys in the room some of the toys let the children play and be aggressive the children were watched how they played with the toys children who saw the aggressive model played aggressively with the toys the children who had a model who was not aggressive played nicer the children played nice because they did not watch the aggressive model to copy the behavior bandura s experiment showed that children can learn behavior from adults by watching the adult s behavior jean piaget started his theory on child development when he questioned the way children think he thought that infants and children had different understandings than adults piaget focused on the cognitive development of children instead of adults cognitive development is studying how adults and children think and learn piaget s work helped to develop new ways of education and programs of discovery learning piaget s theory of cognitive development has three main parts piaget thought children had and made schemas as they developed schemas are ways of making sense of experience a schema is a picture of something in a child s mind the picture is normally of how different things happen in the world the picture helps the child understand and behave in the world an example of a schema would be a child s schema for being in a classroom the child s picture would have things like students sitting in chairs at desks a teacher is in the front of the class teaching this schema helps the child know how to act and know what might happen in the classroom piaget thought that the first schemas have to do with the child s reaction to the world piaget thought that babies are born with some schemas without learning them these schemas are sensorimotor actions the schemas are very simple schemas get more complex as the child gets older the child starts to think before acting when the child does this it uses mental representations or pictures in the mind that are representative of different things the mental representations can be changed in the mind into new ideas piaget thought that the two most powerful mental representations are images and concepts images are pictures in the mind of objects people and spaces concepts put the images together in different groups schemas can be changed and made from putting together and changing images and concepts in the child s mind piaget thought that a child s mind changes to better fit with the world through adaption children use adaptation by changing schemas to fit the world piaget thought that adaptation has two parts assimilation and accommodation in assimilation children use the schemes they have to understand the world children s schemes do not always right when a child has a schema that is not right they have to change it this is called accommodation in accommodation new schemes are made or old ones are changed the changes must take place so the child can better understand the world piaget thought there is a balance between assimilation and accommodation he called the balance cognitive equilibrium when a child s schemes fit their understanding of the world then the child is in equilibrium when the schemes do not fit the child is in disequilibrium piaget called the moving between equilibrium and disequilibrium equilibration piaget broke his stages of cognitive development of children into four stages the stages always go in the same order the stages also happen to children everywhere at each stage there are key details that happen in that stage the sensorimotor stage is the first stage of piaget s theory in this stage babies think with their eyes ear and hands children in this stage learn about the world through their senses piaget thought that children in this stage learn by doing the same acts over and over these acts come from their sense experience piaget called this circular reaction there are two main kinds of circular reaction primary and secondary one month olds use primary circular reaction in primary circular reaction children do acts that have to do with their basic needs like eating four to eight month olds use secondary circular reaction secondary circular reaction happens when children try to make events happen with their acts secondary circular reaction in children helps to control their own behavior eight to twelve month olds can control their behavior in the sensorimotor stage children gain object permanence this happens between and months object permanence is knowing that a thing is still in existence even if the child cannot see it object permanence is seen in children eight to twelve months old object permanence can be seen in piaget s object hiding task in the task a toy is hidden under a blanket if the baby can find the toy than the baby has learned object permanence preoperational stagethe preoperational stage has a large change in representative thought in the mind in this stage children can use symbols to represent their knowledge children also learn language in the preoperational stage piaget did not think language was that important for cognitive development he thought that children use words to explain the pictures of experience in their mind in the preoperational stage children have egocentricism egocentricism is when children cannot tell the difference between their view point and someone else s piaget used the three mountains problem to show egocentricism in the problem a doll is placed on one side of a group of mountains a child is placed on a different side the child is asked to tell what the doll sees a child who has egocentricism tells what he or she sees and not what the doll sees this is for the simple wiki page on child development in the concrete operational stage children s thought becomes more logical logical thought uses reason when thinking children are able to understand changes between things that are in front of them they still have a hard time with things that they have to imagine children in the concrete operational stage can place items in different arrangements they understand that things can be placed into more than one group at a time children in the concrete operational stage can also put things in order of qualities like length and weight the understanding of conservation happens in the concrete operational stage children who understand conservation know that changing a things shape or container does not change how much is there for example in conservation of liquid children know that the amount of liquid does not change if it is put in a different glass in the formal operational stage children are able to think about abstract ideas the abstract ideas are ones that are within the child s mind and not in front of them in the world in this stage children can come up with rules about how things can happen without needing concrete items piaget believed that there were two main parts of the formal operational stage hypothetico deductive reasoning and propositional thought in hyothetico deductive reasoning children are able to guess the outcome of a problem they are able to do this by making guesses that can be tested in an experiment by testing the guesses they learn if their guess was right and if not why it was not in propositional thought children are able to understand if spoken statements are true they are able to do so without needing to see an example of those statements lev vygotsky built his theory of child development on the importance of three things vygotsky thought that children s development was formed from mainly social and cultural interactions interactions occur when two or more people talk and or work together vygotsky thought that culture has a big affect on how cognitive growth develops vygotsky also focused on language he felt language was very important for changing how a child thinks vygotsky thought that child development during the first two years have to do with direct connection with the world after the two years language changes the way a child thinks language is important because it is how adults pass on ideas to children vygotsky felt that growth of language leads to a huge change in how children think because they can communicate ideas with others children talk to both others and themselves vygotsky thought that children talking to themselves was very important for development he thought that children talk to themselves to help guide their thoughts he called talk directed at the self private speech private speech is used when a job is hard after an error is made or when the child is unsure of what to do children that use private speech are more attentive and involved in the job they are doing also children who have trouble learning use private speech more this is to help them understand what they are learning vygotsky thought that important learning comes from working with adults or more skilled peers these helpers can help the child to find out how to do different jobs vygotsky thought that there is a range of difficulty that a job needs to be in if the job is in the range than a child can learn best vygotsky called this range the zone of proximal development the zone of proximal development has jobs that are to hard to do alone but are able to be done with help the help would come from a helper when the helper works with the child social interactions occur vygotsky thought that there are two important parts of social interaction intersubjectivity and scaffolding intersubjectivity happens when two people start with different understandings the two people interact with each other by interacting the two people get to the same understanding scaffolding happens when a teacher is helping a child the teacher will change how much they help based on the child s work level the teacher will help more if the child needs it the teacher will also help less if the child does not need help over time the teacher lets the child work alone when the child works alone he or she puts the conversation into his or her private speech the private speech is then used to help the child do the problem", " when children develop into adults their body will change so will the way they see their body and the way their perceive their sexuality child sexuality is also influenced by cultural and social values and by education classical psychoanalysis looks at child sexuality and develops models how it changes over time", " classical conditioning also pavlovian conditioning is a type of learning that happens subconsciously ivan pavlov was the first to show the way in which it works he did this in an experiment using dogs pavlov noticed that the dogs naturally salivated when they saw food this behaviour did not need to be taught in this example the food is an unconditioned stimulus he paired this unconditioned stimulus showing food to the dogs with another neutral stimulus the ringing of a bell pavlov discovered that if the two stimuli are presented together again and again the organism learns that they belong together as a result it is enough to show the neutral stimulus to get a conditioned response or reflex classical conditioning is an important factor in everyday life it can be applied in many areas such as behavioural therapies responses to drugs and in modern day marketing strategies classical conditioning is different from operant conditioning operant conditioning is a different kind of learning it happens when an individual or animal learns a behaviour as a result of a consequence of that behaviour for example a child may learn to open a box to get some sweets so when a behaviour has a good result the organism learns to associate the behaviour with this good result as such learning the behaviour and repeating it so operant conditioning explains voluntary changes in behaviour classical conditioning explains how reflexes are trained the same learning process that develops a conditioned response can be used to teach a new behaviour or change old ones some mental health therapies are often linked to classical conditioning aversion therapy aims to stop a harmful behaviour by replacing a positive response with a negative one this makes a person associate the harmful behaviour with a bad feeling for example a doctor can give a person a medicine that makes them sick unwell if they drink alcohol this person will learn to associate the drinking of alcohol with feeling ill systematic desensitisation is often used to treat phobias and other anxiety disorders the person is exposed to what they fear or what causes them to feel anxious the therapy aims to condition a response of relaxation instead this is a form of counterconditioning in time the feared stimulus produces a conditioned response of relaxation flooding is similar to desensitisation this therapy directly exposes the person to their phobias and anxieties for example a person who is claustrophobic is locked in a small room for some time this aims to expose the person to their feared thing in a safe environment and help them overcome their fears there are two kinds of conditioned drug responses first a drug user may become more tolerant to a drug if it is taken in similar surroundings a similar setting every time this is because the familiar setting will bring about a compensatory response as a result taking the drug in similar settings will help your body tolerate the drug alternatively taking the drug outside of the regular setting will make it harder more difficult for your body to manage its effects for this reason overdose is more common when a user takes a drug in a new setting in other cases the opposite may happen if a stimulus is present every time a drug is taken the stimulus alone may produce a conditioned physiological response the same as the effect of the drug for example people who drink lots of coffee may experience the feeling of being alert wide awake from the smell of coffee so without drinking coffee they experience the same effects from only the smell classical conditioning theory is used in the modern day to elicit a certain response a common example is its use in advertising advertisers will attempt to make consumers associate their product with a good feeling or response for example beauty adverts will use models with clear skin to advertise their products this will make people associate the product with smooth healthy skin other examples of strategies used to make a positive advertisement are using happy music good looking models and cute animals and babies", " clinical psychology is the study in psychology of mental disorders it is about learning understanding diagnosing treating or preventing these types of illnesses clinical psychologists examine the mental functioning of a person and use psychotherapy to treat the disorder psychotherapy uses talking instead of medical or physical treatments the first psychological clinic opened in at the university of pennsylvania by lightner witmer in the first half of the th century clinical psychology mainly about psychological assessment not treatment after world war ii there was a big increase in the numbers of trained clinical psychologists there are two main educational models the ph d scientist practitioner model which looks at research and the psy d practitioner scholar model which looks at treatment clinical psychologists are now regarded as experts in psychotherapy clinical psychologists generally train in one of four primary academic areas psychodynamic humanistic behavior therapy cognitive behavioral and systems or family therapy sigmund freud s ideas led to the development of psychodynamic psychotherapy its goal is to help the patient or client to understand the meaning of the unconscious desires and conflicts that have caused their problems humanistic psychology was developed in the s in reaction to both behaviourism the belief that conditioning is the main cause of human behavior and psychoanalysis the belief that the unconscious is the main cause of human behavior the major principles of humanistic psychology are", " when they are in a noisy environment humans have the ability to focus their hearing onto one source this phenomenon is called cocktail party effect it is named after the fact that a person attending a noisy cocktail party is able to focus their listening to the conversation they are doing and disregard the other conversations it has been proposed that one s sensory memory subconsciously parses all stimuli and identifies discrete pieces of information by classifying them by salience this effect is what allows most people to tune into a single voice and tune out all others this phenomenon is often described in terms of selective attention or selective hearing it may also describe a similar phenomenon that occurs when one may immediately detect words of importance coming from unattended stimuli for example hearing one s name among a wide range of auditory input an inability to segregate stimuli in this way is sometimes referred to as the cocktail party problem or cocktail party deafness", " cognition is the scientific word for the thought process this process is the way we think the word comes from the latin word cognoscere which means to know or to recognize cognitive psychology is the science which studies cognition", " a cognitive bias happens when someone makes a bad choice that they think is a good choice this bias is an important part of the study of cognitive psychology cognitive biases are often because of evolution some behaviors were good for primitive humans and animals that seem foolish today the scientific method limits the results of cognitive bias", " cognitive dissonance is a concept in social psychology it is the discomfort felt by a person who holds conflicting ideas beliefs or values at the same time in this state people may feel surprise dread guilt anger or embarrassment reacting to this unpleasant state people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance leon festinger s theory of cognitive dissonance was developed to predict and explain how people reacted to this situation cognitive dissonance theory says that people have a bias to seek consonance between their expectations and reality according to festinger people engage in a process he termed dissonance reduction this can be got in one of three ways people in dissonance may change their feelings thoughts or memories so they are less in conflict however often they do not and instead set out to manipulate the social scene around them so that their embarrassment is less for example they may try to explain away the dissonance with a wider theory or they may intensify their efforts at persuasion and publicity so that others join them in their beliefs festinger s book when prophecy fails is the story of how a cult leader reacted when her prophecy of doom failed festinger and his associates read an interesting item in their local newspaper prophecy from planet clarion call to city flee that flood the prophecy came from dorothy martin a chicago housewife who experimented with automatic writing she had previously been involved with l ron hubbard s dianetics movement and her cult incorporated ideas from what was to become scientology the group of believers had taken steps which showed their commitment to the belief they had left jobs college and spouses and had given away money and possessions they prepared for their departure on a flying saucer which was to rescue the group of true believers she claimed to have received a message from a fictional planet named clarion these messages revealed that the world would end in a great flood before dawn on december after the failure of the prediction dorothy martin left chicago after being threatened with arrest and involuntary commitment she later founded the association of sananda and sanat kumara under the name sister thedra she continued to practice channeling and to participate in contactee groups until her death in the association is active to this day festinger and his colleagues infiltrated martin s group and reported the following sequence of events the experiences supported the idea that the group did have a bias to seek consonance between their expectations and reality in fact events had proved conclusively the falsehood of their ideas but the group rearranged their explanations to give themselves the least psychological pain", " cognitive distortions are irrational or exaggerated thoughts that can cause some psychological problems to become worse by following these wrong thought they make if very hard to do the things they want to do this may cause problems such as depression there are many forms of cognitive distortions some of these include", " cognitive neuropsychology is a subject in psychology it is a combination of biology and cognitive psychology these psychologists study human behavior and knowledge this is a growing subject that is used more and more everyday unlike cognitive neuroscience cognitive neuropsychology pays attention to the mind rather than the brain many scientists have worked to make cognitive neuropsychology their findings have created an understanding of the brain and how humans learn and do things most of these scientists were not psychologists but are known for their contributions to psychology the technology today also helps advance what is known with brain imaging and other methods the brain can now be visualized cognitive neuroscience can also be broken into different topics such as memory attention language and emotion the early history of cognitive neuropsychology begins with humans first acknowledgement of the mind brain beliefs in the importance of the mind brain head emerge as early as bc with the sumerians records of sumerian intake of the poppy plant which contains opium include descriptions of the mind altering affects upon ingestion this suggests a reference to the brain another clue pointing towards acknowledgement of the brain is the discovery of skulls with holes drilled into them in bc discovery of these skulls points to cultural acknowledgement of the brain as important to life the motivation behind these drillings could vary from spiritual to medical the greatest contribution to early cognitive neuropsychology came from egypt in bc this marks the development of the edwin smith surgical papyrus this document included the first written description of the human brain these writings include descriptions of meninges and cerebrospinal fluid the next development emerged from ancient greece from philosophers aristotle plato and almaceon the ancient greeks hypothesized the form and function of the mind psyche and soul aristotle s theory focused on the heart as the seat of the mind he saw the heart containing all emotion and thinking he also thought that the brain functioned to cool the heart down unlike aristotle plato believed the brain to be the locale for mental processes with aristotle we see the emergence of the dualistic view of mind and body the dualistic versus monistic approach to the mind and brain is a debate dominating much of the history of cognitive neuroscience the developments in cognitive neuropsychology following this time were few and far between due to church credence against human dissection this limited the uncovering of new information at this time we see a noteworthy development by galen galen was a roman physician whose surgical descriptions of neurology helped describe the anatomy of the brain and neurological disorders many unskilled physicians attempted dissections in secret but with no real scientific discoveries occurring by the middle of the th century there was an increase in cognitive neuropsychology development this happened after the lull caused by the church during the renaissance cognitive neuropsychology gains many noteworthy contributions these contributions involve a deeper understanding of the brain and its subsections we see vesalius publication of the first neuroscience textbook in and his description of the hydrocephalus in we also see the first use of the term hippocampus in this is when the brain was starting to be seen as a complex organ responsible for many operations of the body towards the end of the s a french philosopher and mathematician by the name of ren descartes was born he was the most well known figure in cognitive neuropsychology at this time some of descartes contributions stemmed from his interest in the nervous system and brain s role in behavior he posited that the nervous system was made up of hollow tubes which filled with animal spirits any time an action were to take place in that part of the body his other contributions included the more developed notion of dualism he hypothesized that the brain and mind are two separate entities that exist on their own but are interdependent on each other he theorized that the pineal gland in the brain is where these two separate entities interacted descartes dualistic theory serves as his most influential contribution to cognitive neuropsychology during the th century science began to be big in the history of cognitive neuropsychology the first big advance was in human reflexes these bodily reactions to stimuli or outside forces are observed and measured this was found by studying axons and learning how signals travel in the human body before this science and technology were not advanced enough but the th century changed this in fact the development of the microscope helped as well the brain s nerve fibers could now be seen and described cerebrospinal fluid csf was also found in the spaces of the brain and spinal cord with that the physiology of psychology began to take control of cognition these findings are all still true today another advance occurred with electroconvulsion therapy ect or electric shock therapy this was a method used to treat mental disorders ect causes electricity to shock a person s brain this stimulates all of the brain causing mental disorders to go away and be cured this was used to treat blindness hysteria depression and many other disorders it was thought to be the way of the future in treating disabilities the th century started the argument of localism vs holism in cognitive neuropsychology people were starting to question holism and explore the idea of localism localism means that the brain has individual areas that are responsible for certain actions in the body the study of phrenology started these localization theories phrenology is looking at the human skull and finding strange bumps to be measured any strange bumps or shapes in the skull were then paired with intelligence or self traits in a person these traits could include language logic and even love if a part of the skull was pushed out it would mean that trait was better this started localization theories the next big thing in cognitive neuroscience has to do with ablation studies this is when parts of the brain were removed so function could be measured without this brain area for example a neuropsychologist can remove the cerebellum after it is removed the animal s balance was not good this links the cerebellum to balance as for brain damage the most famous case is with phineas gage this patient was working on the railroad when a piece of metal went through the front of his head he did not die from this brain injury however his normal personality changed this brought the idea that the frontal cortex the part of the brain that was stabbed controlled how a person acted another study found the localization of language in the brain two separate scientists studied patients with language problems they found that their patients all had lesions or damage in two certain areas of their brain one area known as broca s area controlled talking the other area wernicke s area was found to control understanding of language this way of looking at problems in the brain lead to studies of epileptic patients an epileptic patient is a person that frequently suffers from seizures these seizures were studied to learn more about how the brain sends electrical signals these electrical signals were then measured it was found that each neuron can send a signal at certain speeds these neurons were then dyed with a stain in order to be seen at first it was thought that all nerves were connected like a web called a nerve net however with more complex stain it was found that each nerve is separate and can fire on their own in the early part of the th century there was a long time that cognitive neuropsychology was not studied this was partly because of the influence of john b watson who was a behaviorist in psychology he argued that cognition could not be studied scientifically because it could not be observed so for the first half of the th century psychology as a field was dominated by behaviorism which was mainly stimuli and a person s response to it john b watson was only one psychologist to criticize cognitive psychology pierre marie in criticized broca who was one of the first to create the field of cognitive neuropsychology henry head in also attacked the whole field of cognitive neuropsychology due to these criticisms and the influence of behaviorism cognitive neuropsychology was dormant for many years another reason why cognitive neuropsychology disappeared in the early twentieth century was because the science was not yet advanced enough many cognitive psychologists were also neurologists these two fields of study were not separate yet as they are today these neurologists wanted to study modules in the brain and localize them with parts of the brain but technology did not allow this yet the methods used today were not yet created they could only study where a person s brain lesion was by doing an autopsy after the person was already dead this was a lot of the reason this field was criticized against and why many people believed cognition could not be studied scientifically in the middle of the twentieth century there was a transition called the cognitive revolution in psychology this is when psychologists began to agree that there were scientific ways to study cognition these new beliefs about cognitive psychology were brought on by john c marshall s and nora newcombe s study of reading and shallice and warrington s study of memory in the early s in the mid s the first undergraduate book was published by ellis young named human cognitive neuropsychology there was also an emergence of new technology that made it easier to study the brain and the mind the s and s was the time period that cognitive neuropsychology became visible and many psychologists started studying it after an important feature of the later half of the twentieth century was the clear separation of cognitive neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience cognitive neuropsychologists study the human mind after brain damage has occurred and focus more on cognition cognitive neuroscientists study the human brain and neural systems after brain damage has occurred and focus more attention on the neurons while the cognitive neuroscientists are concerned with how the brain works and what parts of the brain is responsible for what functions cognitive neuropsychologists want to study people with brain damage to try and see how the human mind works with this information they can formulate theories about the human mind and also make better therapies for people with brain damage an important feature that was developed in the twentieth century is the way that research is conducted since every single person s brain damage is different cognitive neuropsychologists study only single cases instead of groups of people or syndromes psychologists study the mind by looking at people who lost some sort of function after brain damage occurred for example if a person could recognize both faces and objects before brain damage occurred but then after brain damage in a certain part of the brain they could only recognize faces and not objects then psychologists can make inferences about the functions in certain modules of the brain the late th century was also when they began using computational models of cognition the psychologists would make theories and install them into a computer then virtually damage the fake brain where the patient had damage by doing this they can get a better look at how the mind works this is one way that technology has helped in studying the human mind this along with the invention of the devices to scan the brain has made a big difference in cognitive neuropsychology cognitive neuropsychologists use the method of double dissociation when studying the modules of the mind this is when they use many patients who have had brain damage and try to figure out which parts of the brain are responsible for different cognition this concept of modularity was developed by jerry fodor in his book the modularity of the mind psychologists disagree as to how much and which parts of the mind is constructed modules in this century cognitive neuropsychologists use many methods to study the mind they use machines that scan the brain to see where the damage is and then study cognitive abilities of these patients they still use double dissociation for studying the patients case studies computational models and many other features that were invented in the late twentieth century with new technology there is likely to be a lot of improvement in this field cognitive neuropsychology uses of investigations of people with problems of cognition to learn more about normal cognitive processes this is possible through the many technological advances such as", " cognitive behavioral therapy cbt is a type of psychotherapy which aims to help people transform their maladaptive thoughts and behaviours into a better state of being psychologists task patients to try out different situational coping skills and help patients to acknowledge then challenge those problematic thought patterns feelings and behaviors cbt refers to many types of psychotherapeutic systems that deal with cognitions interpretations beliefs and responses these systems come from strategies commonly used in cognitive therapy and behavior therapy combining them this combination is used to identify problems faced in the present and tries to improve the patient s current state of mind cbt has emerged as a common treatment for concerns regarding moods it has become increasingly popular for reasons such as its defined structure and that it is based on common sense research shows that cbt is the most effective form of treatment for those coping with depression and anxiety cbt alone is effective for overcoming depression and anxiety after modules medication alone is effective however science still does not understand the long term effects on the brain and body there is evidence which suggests that cbt may be more cost efficient in the long run in comparison to medication although a combination of medication and cbt seems to be the most effective in overcoming mental illness in particular antidepressants paired with cbt could reduce potential relapses in patients facing depression cbt is often recommended for mood related disorders such as depression and anxiety but it can also treat personality disorders post traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders cbt can take place one on one between a therapist and a client during group therapy or online in the early s austrian psychotherapist alfred adler s notion of basic mistakes and their role in unpleasant emotions made him one of the earliest therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy his work inspired american psychologist albert ellis to develop rational emotive behaviour therapy rebt in the s this is now considered one of the earliest forms of cognitive psychotherapy it is based on the idea that a person s emotional distress arises from their thoughts about an event rather than the actual event itself in the s and s american psychiatrist aaron t beck noticed that his clients had internal dialogues going on in their minds during analytical sessions he discovered that the clients appeared to almost be talking to themselves but they only shared a small part of this kind of thinking with him for example a person might have thought to themselves the therapist is being very quiet today i wonder if he s mad at me and then began to feel anxious as a result cbt is based on a cognitive model of mental illness which beck proposed as shown in the example above the model suggests our emotions are a result of our interpretations of events beck put forward three levels of cognition which are core beliefs dysfunctional assumptions and negative automatic thoughts core beliefs seems to be a common issue in patients an example is beck s negative triad this is composed of what seems to be irrational thoughts about the self the world and the future this may be evident in patients facing depression beck used his model as a starting point to develop cbt so that we can improve our understanding about emotions and behaviour in the s a number of empirical studies into how cognitions affect behaviours and emotions were carried out this is known as the cognitive revolution it emphasised the role that conscious thinking plays in psychotherapy and is known as the second wave of cbt cbt targets different kinds of maladaptive thinking the goal is to recognise unhealthy thoughts and develop them into positive thinking patterns in that sense cbt is scientific because irrational beliefs are thought of as theories which are tested to see if they are true cbt is structured in that it uses an abc format a represents the activating event which triggers b your beliefs this is followed by c the consequences which are your actions beliefs are composed of different types of thinking some examples include catastrophising where small problems are blown out of proportion and all or nothing thinking which involves thinking in extremes when creating solutions the therapist and patient need to come to an agreement on attainable goals they follow a criteria which is characterised as smart specific measurable achievable realistic and time limited specific and measurable highlight the science behind cbt as the goals are used to test the hypothesis achievable realistic and time limited ensure that the patient makes small stages of progress through the intervention one of the key reasons why cbt is so effective is because of its interactive nature this is known as collaborative empiricism the patient and therapist work together in targeting problems and changing negative mindsets this means that patients play an active role in improving their mental health which is a key element that distinguishes cbt from other treatments therapists encourage patients to be active by setting them tasks this may be noting down positive moments throughout their day or producing a list of things to complete cbt combines cognitive and behavioural methods to maximise its effect therapists often set their patients homework which challenge their irrational beliefs when patients feel down because of these beliefs the therapist can produce this as evidence an example of a behavioural method is that therapists help their patients to collect evidence that challenges the use of their avoidance behaviours the techniques aim to prepare patient with the skills they need to target their problems independently in the future cognitive behavior therapy can be effectively used as a short term treatment centered on helping people with a very specific problem and teaching them to focus on present thoughts and beliefs cbt is now increasingly recommended because it is successful in changing the patient s way of thinking as previously mentioned it s effective because patients participate in improving their mental health they are encouraged to be proactive by acting as their own therapist this means that once the sessions are over patients are left with the skills they need to manage their problems furthermore it works because the patient and therapist develop a healthy relationship it is built upon understanding cooperation and empathy therapists show patience when patients struggle to identify their negative thoughts or when adopting new coping mechanisms compromise is also a key element in this relationship if a strategy is not working they are willing to work together to find a better solution it is also effective because cbt focuses mainly on the present it does not dive into the patient s past because cbt aims to improve the patient s current state of mind despite its popular recommendations cbt has faced criticism arguably cbt fails to focus on the patient as a whole this may be because cbt focuses solely on the patient s present by ignoring the patient s past therapists may be overlooking the origin of their maladaptive thinking this makes it difficult to identify solutions if the therapist ignores the underlying issue furthermore cbt is known for its interactive element this may be counterproductive in patients who face mood related disorders which are associated with reduced energy levels such as depression since the emergence of cbt several revisions and models have been made one example is the five areas model this model was created because traditional cbt tends to use complex terms which may be unsuitable for some patients or colleagues who do not specialise in cbt the five areas model aims to be more versatile by using language that can easily be understood in that sense this model is not a new approach instead it is a revision of standard cbt the five areas model specifically focuses on five key elements hence the name these are life situation altered thinking altered emotions altered physical feelings and altered behaviour ", " collective unconscious refers to the things

his book study of organ inferiority and its physical compensation he wrote if a person feels inferior weak then they will usually try to compensate for it somewhere else adler s reason to explore this was from his own experience he was shy and yet he pushed himself to give lectures adler also transferred this idea of compensation to psychic training narcissistic people by compensation theory hide

borderline personality disorder ", " dissociative identity disorder did is a mental disorder it was called multiple personality disorder mpd it is listed in the mental health diagnosis manual dsm iv this is one of the most controversial mental disorders because people disagree about what causes it the main symptoms of did are a person showing two or more identities or personality states the person behaves differently depending which identity is in control the second important symptom is when a person forgets important personal things which people normally do not forget a person is not diagnosed with did if the symptoms are caused by drugs illness or with children pretending to play with imaginary friends doctors must also rule out pretending to have did for attention or sympathy and malingering pretending to have did for some personal gain most patients with did are also diagnosed with other mental disorders the dsm iv uses the terms identity personality states and alternate identities when talking about did and other people use the term alters to mean the same thing these words can be confusing since not everyone uses the same definition professionals have not agreed on a specific definition for a personality other terms including dissociation and amnesia may also be defined differently by different professionals when talking about did saying someone changes personalities or alters means the person speaks and acts differently and usually responds to a different name dissociation is a symptom most people experience normal dissociation where they stop paying attention to what is happening around them people with did have pathological dissociation which is much more serious it involves problems with memory and attention that make it hard for people to work shop and have relationships with other people everyone can dissociate but some people can do it much more easily and to an extreme that can be unhealthy some doctors think trauma causes the dissociation that is seen in disorders like did according to the dsm iv the symptoms of did are the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states which are often called alters as well as forgetting things that people normally don t forget also the symptoms cannot be caused by drugs or normal childhood play people can report having a lot of alters or just a couple most people diagnosed with did have less than ten though some have said they have several thousand a person diagnosed with did cannot be diagnosed with another dissociative disorder because people with did hear voices of different alters it may be confused with schizophrenia however the two problems are very different and doctors can usually tell if a patient has did or schizophrenia by asking the right questions did is always diagnosed by what patients tell their doctors and what the doctor thinks this means there are no objective tests using blood or machines that can tell if someone has did though people have tried diagnosing and studying did using medical imaging or brain scanning  the dsm uses the following criteria to diagnose did the international classification of diseases icd uses the term multiple personality disorder instead of dissociative identity disorder it classifies did in section f other dissociative conversion disorders there are two main ideas about what causes did but there is still disagreement about which is correct the trauma model says that did is caused by parents or family that abuse or neglect their children some of these children deny the abuse is happening or pretend it is happening to someone else and this eventually becomes a different identity or alter most people diagnosed with did say they remember being abused by their parents or other caregivers when they were children when asked about their childhood patients with did are more likely to say they were abused or neglected than people with any other diagnosis however the idea that did develops in childhood is disputed because childhood memories are not very reliable and it is not clear if the abuse actually happened though did has been diagnosed in children there are reasons to believe the diagnosis is because of the influence of parents and doctors rather than abuse there is not enough good scientific evidence about did in childhood to be sure did is actually caused by abuse or something else the iatrogenic or sociocognitive model scm of did says it is created during psychotherapy when the therapist creates false memories and patients become convinced they have multiple personalities some patients may be more likely to develop did in these circumstances because they are naturally more likely to accept their therapists are right about did scm supporters also think that patients have seen did in movies and books and this shows them how people with did are supposed to behave which makes it easier for them to change their behavior when they are supposed to be a new alter they also say the criteria used by the dsm are unclear which makes it hard to agree whether a patient has did or another diagnosis a middle position says that trauma may change how the brain remembers things which makes it easier to remember things that did not actually happen it has also been suggested that early trauma may make children more likely to use their imaginations to pretend abuse or other painful situations are not happening and if they enter therapy when they are older it is easier for therapists to convince them they have did there is no treatment approach that has been scientifically proven to work most therapists who treat patients with did use several different approaches therapy usually lasts for several years and does not always work some therapists try to reduce or eliminate the alters so the patient only has one personality while others do not the isstd recommends first improving a patient s ability to deal with symptoms and live more normal lives then trying to deal with traumatic memories the final step is bringing all the identities together so the patient can access all of their memories sometimes patients with did will get better without any help but this is not common patients with more diagnoses than just did often take longer to improve there have been no large scale studies to learn how common did is the isstd says did occurs in between and in the general population and between and in groups of patients in hospitals did is more common in women than in men but this may be caused by men with did being sent to prison instead of hospitals the number of people diagnosed with did increased from about in to about in the s according to the isstd this is because doctors did not have the training or experience to recognize did instead they diagnosed people with depression ptsd or borderline personality disorder people who support the scm say the increase in diagnoses was because a small number of doctors diagnosed a large number of people and because a large number of therapists began using types of psychotherapy that made people think they had did before it was thought did was caused by spirits or ghosts who controlled people s behavior the first case of did described in medicine was in by the swiss doctor paracelsus did was very uncommon until the s between and the number of cases reported in medicine went from about to more than in the th edition of the dsm was published which changed the name from multiple personality disorder to dissociative identity disorder the dsm also changed how did was diagnosed many scientific articles were written about did during the same period though after the number of articles published every year decreased today there is little research on did even though did is a very rare there are a lot of books plays and movies about people with did in robert louis stevenson published the short book the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde which was very popular people later thought that dr jekyll and mr hyde were examples of someone with did the three faces of eve was a movie made in about a woman with did sybil a popular book about a woman with did was published in it was made into a movie in and a second time in a survey done in of american and canadian psychiatrists found that there was a lot of disagreement and skepticism about diagnosing did and if the diagnosis was based on enough good quality science lawyers and doctors who work with the law also consider did to be very controversial since the s did has become more common in courts people have tried to avoid going to prison for such crimes as murder and serial rape by claiming to have did and lawyers and judges are concerned about people pretending to have did to avoid going to prison

in some ways but can also be very strange dreams can seem so real while they happen that the person might think that they are awake when actually they are asleep sometimes a person realizes during a dream that they are dreaming but keeps having the dream this is called a lucid dream this happens very little for most people but for some people it happens often during lucid dreaming the person will feel like they are controlling the dream and will usually dream that they are doing fun things that they can t do in the real world most people remember their dreams in some way or another even if it is only a small part but children are very likely to remember most of their dream clearly it is often easier for people to remember dreams if they write down what happened in the dream just after they wake up because of this many people have dream diaries where they describe each dream they have nightmares are dreams which scare or shock people nightmares are usually based around that person s everyday fears like spiders or dark places but even a dream that s not about those things can feel unpleasant nightmares are caused by many different things being uncomfortable or in pain while sleeping sickness stress or even eating right before sleeping there are many different theories about why people dream and what their dreams mean every person has different dreams some psychologists believe that dreams reflect what is happening in the unconscious mind the part of the mind that works by itself others think that people places and objects in dreams are symbols for other things in the dreamer s real life throughout history people have tried to make sense of dreams to learn things from them and have often used them for divination or fortune telling today there are still many books and websites devoted to making sense of dreams generally speaking ancient civilisations thought dreams were messages from the gods see the works of homer or alternatively some kind of prophecy however they knew that often dreams misled the dreamer and invented various explanations for this aristotle started off with ideas like this but later became more skeptical and denied the divine origin of dreams in his interpretation of dreams sigmund freud connected them to his ideas on psychotherapy dreams in freud s view are forms of wish fulfillment they are attempts by the unconscious to resolve a conflict of some sort because the information in the unconscious is in an unruly and often disturbing form a censor in the preconscious will not allow it to pass unaltered into the conscious freud describes three main types of dreams direct prophecies received in the dream the foretelling of a future event the symbolic dream which requires interpretation some authors such as hans eysenck have argued that the dreams freud cites do not really support his theories eysenck argues that freud s examples actually disprove his dream theory since freud the emphasis has been on the biology of dreaming the discovery of rem rapid eye movement and non rem sleep has been important researchers have done many studies on this subjects have been woken up in both stages and asked what they were thinking about it is clear that the reports from non rem stages were different from rem stages in particular dreams occur mostly when the brain is in the rem state there is also some relationship between dreaming and daydreams both seem to occur in a cycle of minutes apparently there is no evidence that a more useful understanding of personality can be gained from them than can be divined from the realities of waking behaviour if sleep is prevented people suffer and get worse at every kind of waking activity from this it is clear that one important function of sleep is to maintain normal brain activity during awake time somehow during sleep the brain gets restored to its normal functioning sleep is so far as is known universal amongst vertebrates that also argues for its great importance however it is not known whether dreaming supports this repair function of sleep or whether it is something which just happens", " an eating disorder is when someone begins eating too much

client s readiness and develops a treatment plan client and therapist identify possible targets for emdr processing these include distressing memories and current situations that cause emotional distress other targets may include related incidents in the past emphasis is placed on the development of specific skills and behaviors that will be needed by the client in future situations initial emdr processing may be directed to childhood events rather than to adult onset stressors or the identified critical incident if the client had a problematic childhood clients generally gain insight on their situations the emotional distress resolves and they start to change their behaviors the length of treatment depends upon the number of traumas and the age of ptsd onset generally those with single event adult onset trauma can be successfully treated in under hours multiple trauma victims may require a longer treatment time phase during the second phase of treatment the therapist ensures that the client has several different ways of handling emotional distress the therapist may teach the client a variety of imagery and stress reduction techniques the client can use during and between sessions a goal of emdr therapy is to produce rapid and effective change while the client maintains equilibrium during and between sessions phases in phases three to six a target is identified and processed using emdr therapy procedures these involve the client identifying three things the vivid visual image related to the memory a negative belief about self related emotions and body sensations in addition the client identifies a positive belief the therapist helps the client rate the positive belief as well as the intensity of the negative emotions after this the client is instructed to focus on the image negative thought and body sensations while simultaneously engaging in emdr processing using sets of bilateral stimulation these sets may include eye movements taps or tones the type and length of these sets is different for each client at this point the emdr client is instructed to just notice whatever spontaneously happens after each set of stimulation the clinician instructs the client to let his her mind go blank and to notice whatever thought feeling image memory or sensation comes to mind depending upon the client s report the clinician will choose the next focus of attention these repeated sets with directed focused attention occur numerous times throughout the session if the client becomes distressed or has difficulty in progressing the therapist follows established procedures to help the client get back on track when the client reports no distress related to the targeted memory s he is asked to think of the preferred positive belief that was identified at the beginning of the session at this time the client may adjust the positive belief if necessary and then focus on it during the next set of distressing events phase in phase seven closure the therapist asks the client to keep a log during the week the log should document any related material that may arise it serves to remind the client of the self calming activities that were mastered in phase two phase the next session begins with phase eight phase eight consists of examining the progress made thus far the emdr treatment processes all related historical events current

to mean the mental state of a person completely immersed in an activity it is an altered state of consciousness the person is fully focused performing actively and successfully the situation is widely recognized by phrases like in the zone in the bubble on the ball in the moment wired in in the groove the performer almost loses touch with their surroundings phrases like lost to the world reflect this mental absorption the term flow was given to this experience by a psychologist mihaly csikszentmihalyi he said it was completely focused motivation the hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous joy even rapture while performing a task flow is also described as a deep focus on nothing but the activity not even oneself or one s emotions a flow state can be entered while performing any activity although it is most likely to occur when one is wholeheartedly performing a task or activity for intrinsic purposes intrinsic purposes involve anything that someone does merely because they want to extrinsic activities will not cause flow to occur extrinsic activities are anything that someone does because there is some other force causing them to do it extrinsic activities will not cause flow to occur passive activities like taking a bath or even watching tv usually do not elicit flow experiences as individuals have to actively do something to enter a flow state while the activities that induce flow may vary and be multifaceted csikszentmih lyi asserts that the experience of flow is similar despite the activity cs kszentmih lyi identifies the following ten factors as accompanying an experience of flow not all are needed for flow to be experienced flow operates on both physical and mental tasks it applies to dance football chess and many other areas where people perform tasks in well defined competitive situations but also in art where the situation may be much more open evidence about flow comes from interviews with people after various types of performance

apathy is characterized by having little to no challenges in a situation a person s skill level is also characterized as apathy when the person has a general lack of interest in the task at hand boredom is a slightly different state in that it occurs when challenges are low but one s skill level exceeds those challenges causing one to seek higher challenges a state of anxiety occurs when challenges are so high that they exceed one s perceived skill level causing one great distress and uneasiness", " the forgetting curve is an idea from psychology that shows how rapidly people forget things if they do nothing to retain them german psychologist hermann ebbinghaus discovered it a related concept is the strength of memory people with a stronger memory are able to remember things longer ebbinghaus tested how long he could remember random syllables and recorded the results in his paper ber das ged chtnis in this was translated into english as memory a contribution to experimental psychology ebbinghaus studied the memorisation of nonsense syllables such as wid and zof cvcs or consonant vowel consonant by repeatedly testing himself after various time periods and recording the results he plotted these results on a graph creating what is now known as the forgetting curve ebbinghaus investigated the rate of forgetting but not the effect of spaced repetition on the increase in retrievability of memories as a rough guide after minutes people can only recall about of what they memorized after a week only about is left when ebbinghaus did the experiment he used meaningless sequences of syllables in the th century several other researchers repeated the experiment one of them was georg elias m ller for this reason the results are still considered to be valid to be able to remember things better more repetitions are needed things that are needed and used more often will not be forgotten so easily hermann ber das ged chtnis untersuchungen zur

the temperaments are sanguine choleric melancholy and phlegmatic galen a doctor from the roman empire added characteristics to bodily fluids galen thought that to cure illness you need to rebalance the fluids if you for example have too much blood you will need a remedy which is the opposite of warm and damp something cold and dry a sanguine person is an energetic person they are friendly talkative encouraging and creative they like to be noticed by others and to have fun but they tend to forget things they are supposed to do and to be late for dates or appointments if they feel that they are not appreciated they can become depressed sad they tend to lose interest in new hobbies as soon as it is no longer a fun thing to do a choleric is a bossy ambitious and critical person they tend to be good leaders but when they don t have power over everyone they can get into a bad mood they can be bossy to people of the other temperaments they are able to make good plans and do things well by not losing interest a melancholic or melancholy person is a thinker and perfectionist they tend to prefer to spend time alone instead of being in social situations they go by a schedule and are truthful say what they mean they can become depressed because of their perfectionist traits they might suffer in silence and not complain they are independent and able to do things for themselves melancholics can be creative in artistic areas such as poetry and music people tend to say melancholic instead of melancholy the term melancholic in the incorrect way of saying one of these four

trying to change them they may tend to be relaxed lazy and not have a lot of energy", " sigmund freud may september is considered to be the founder of the psychodynamic approach to psychology psychodynamic therapy looks closely at the unconscious drives that motivate people to act in certain ways the role of the mind is something that freud repeatedly talks about because he believes that the mind is responsible for both conscious and unconscious decisions based on drives and forces unconscious desires motivate people to act accordingly the id ego and superego are three aspects of the mind which freud believes makes up a person s personality we are simply actors in the drama of our minds pushed by desire pulled by coincidence underneath the surface our personalities represent the power struggle going on deep within us cash psychology for dummies freud does not believe there is any supernatural force that affects the way we think or has pre programmed us to behave in a certain way his idea of the id explains why people act out in certain ways when it is not in line with the ego or superego religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires freud freud believes that people rely on religion to give explanations for anxieties and tension they do not want to consciously believe in the basis of christian theology states god created humanity in his image genesis but freud argues that humanity created god in their image this reverses the idea of any type of religion because he believes that religion is constructed by the mind the role of the mind is something that freud repeatedly talks about because he believes that the mind is responsible for both conscious and unconscious decisions based on drives and forces the idea that religion causes people to behave in a moral way is incorrect according to freud because he believes that no other force has the power to control the ways in which people act unconscious desires motivate people to act accordingly freud does a significant amount of research studying how people act and interact in a group setting he believes that people act in different ways according to the demands and constraints of the group as a whole in his book group psychology and the analysis of the ego freud argues that the church and organized religion forms an artificial group which requires an external force to keep it together in this type of group everything is dependent on that external force and without it the group would no longer exist groups are necessary according to freud in order to decrease the narcissism in all people by creating libidinal ties with others by placing everyone at an equal level the commonness among different people with different egos allows people to identify with one another this relates to the idea of religion because freud believes that people created religion in order to create these group ties that they unconsciously seek for according to freud s many theories of religion the oedipus complex is utilized in the understanding and mastery of religious beliefs in freud s psychosexual stages he mentions the oedipus complex and the electra complex and how they affect children and their relationships with their same sex parental figure according to freud there is an unconscious desire for one s mother to be a virgin and for one s father to be an all powerful almighty figure freud s interest in greek mythology and religion greatly influenced his psychological theories the oedipus complex is when a boy is jealous of his father the boy strives to possess his mother and ultimately replace his father as a means of no longer having to fight for her undivided attention and affection along with seeking his mother s love boys also experience castration anxiety which is the fear of losing their genitalia boys fear that their fathers will retaliate and castrate them as a result of desiring one s mother while the oedipus complex presents itself in males females experience a different form of incestuous rivalry known as the electra complex girls become jealous of their mothers and begin to feel desire towards their fathers females also experience penis envy which is the parallel reaction to the male experience of castration anxiety females are jealous of their fathers penis and wish to have one as well girls then repress this feeling and instead long for a child of their own this suppression leads to the girl identifying with her mother and acquiring feminine traits according to freud the id is the part of the unconscious that seeks pleasure his idea of the id explains why people act out in certain ways when it is not in line with the ego or superego the id is the part of the mind which holds all of humans most basic and primal instincts it is the impulsive unconscious part of the mind that is based on desire to seek immediate satisfaction the id does not have a grasp on any form of reality or consequence freud explains that the pleasure principle is controlled by the id because it makes people engage in need satisfying behavior without any accordance to what is right or wrong freud compares the id and the ego to a horse and a rider the id is compared to the horse which is directed and controlled by the ego the rider this example goes to show that although the id is supposed to be controlled by the ego they often interact with one another according to the drives of the id freud defines the id as the id cut off from the external world has a world of perception of its own it detects with extraordinary acuteness certain changes in its interior especially oscillations in the tension of its instinctual needs and these changes become conscious as feelings in the pleasure unpleasure series it is hard to say to be sure by what means and with the help of what sensory terminal organs these perceptions come about but it is an established fact that self perceptions coenesthetic feelings and feelings of pleasure unpleasure govern the passage of events in the id with despotic force the id obeys the inexorable pleasure principle in order for people to maintain a realistic sense here on earth the ego is responsible for creating balance between pleasure and pain it is impossible for all desires of the id to be met and the ego realizes this but continues to seek pleasure and satisfaction although the ego does not know the difference between right and wrong it is aware that not all drives can be met at a given time the reality principle is what the ego operates by in order to help satisfy the id s demands as well as compromising according to reality the ego is a person s self composed of unconscious desires the ego takes into account ethical and cultural ideals in order to balance out the desires originating in the id although both the id and the ego are unconscious the ego has close contact with the perceptual system the ego has the function of self preservation which is why it has the ability to control the instinctual demands from the id the ego is first and foremost a bodily ego it is not merely a surface entity but is itself the projection of a surface if we wish to find an anatomical analogy for it we can best identify it with the cortical homunculus of the anatomists which stands on its head in the cortex sticks up its heels faces backwards and as we know has its speech area on the left hand side the ego is ultimately derived from bodily sensations chiefly from those springing from the surface of the body it may thus be regarded as a mental projection of the surface of the body besides as we have seen above figure representing the superficies of the mental apparatus the superego which develops around age four or five incorporates the morals of society freud believes that the superego is what allows the mind to control its impulses that are looked down upon morally the superego can be considered to be the conscience of the mind because it has the ability to distinguish between reality as well as what is right or wrong without the superego freud believes people would act out with aggression and other immoral behaviors because the mind would have no way of understanding the difference between right and wrong the superego is considered to be the consciousness of a person s personality and can override the drives from the id freud separates the superego into two separate categories the ideal self and the conscious the conscious contains ideals and morals that exist within society that prevent people from acting out based on their internal desires the ideal self contains images of how people ought to behave according to society s ideals freud believed that the answers to what controlled daily actions resided in the unconscious mind despite alternative views that all our behaviors were conscious notions of the unconsciousness gaps in the consciousness can be explained by other acts of which the consciousness affords no evidence the unconscious mind positions itself in every aspect our life whether one is dormant or awake it is more than just a habitat for our undesired memories we are at loss to what truly exists here though unaware of the effect of the unconscious mind it influences the actions we engage it human behavior should be understood by searching for analysis of mental processes in expressions of individual states this explanation gives significance to verbal slips and dreams they are caused by hidden reasons in the mind displayed in concealed forms verbal slips of the unconscious mind are referred to as a freudian slip this is a term coined by freud to explain a spoken mistake derived from the unconscious mind traumatizing information of thoughts and beliefs are blocked from the conscious mind slips expose our true thoughts stored in the unconscious sexual instincts or drives have deeply invested roots in the unconscious mind instincts act by giving vitality and enthusiasm to the mind through meaning and purpose the ranges of instincts are in great numbers therefore freud expressed them in two categories eros is the self preserving life instinct containing all erotic pleasures in contrast thanatos is the death instinct full of self destruction of sexual energy the main part of human behavior and actions is tied back to sexual drives since birth the existent of sexual drives can be recognized as one of the most important incentives of life freud s theory of psychosexual development is represented amongst five stages according to freud each stage occurs within a specific time frame of one s life if one becomes fixated in any of the five stages he or she will develop personality traits that coincide with the a specific stage and its focus the first stage is the oral stage an infant is in this stage from birth to eighteen months of age the main focus in the oral stage is pleasure seeking through the infant s mouth during this stage the need for tasting and sucking becomes prominent in producing pleasure oral stimulation is crucial during this stage if the infant s needs are not met during this time frame he or she will be fixated in the oral stage fixation in this stage can lead to adult habits such as thumb sucking smoking over eating and nail biting personality traits can also develop during adulthood that are linked to oral fixation these traits can include optimism and independence or pessimism and hostility the second stage is the anal stage which lasts from eighteen months to three years of age during this stage the infant s pleasure seeking centers are located in the bowels and bladder parents stress toilet training and bowel control during this time period fixation in the anal stage can lead to anal retention or anal expulsion anal retentive characteristics include being overly neat precise and orderly while being anal expulsive involves being disorganized messy and destructive the third stage in psychosexual development is the phallic stage this stage begins at years old and ends when the child reaches six years of age the phallic stage focuses on the genitals as pleasure seeking areas of the body boys in this stage experience the oedipus complex while girls experience the electra complex in both cases the child develops incestuous feelings for the parent of the opposite sex children tend to develop characteristics of the same sex parent during this stage fixation in the phallic stage has different personality traits depending on one s gender males may take great pride in their masculinity and their sexuality while women may become flirtatious and promiscuous in both instances these personality traits are a sign of low self esteem and self worth the fourth stage is the latency stage which begins at the age of six and continues until the age of eleven during this stage there is no pleasure seeking region of the body instead all sexual feelings are repressed thus children are able to develop social skills and find comfort through peer and family interaction the final stage of psychosexual development is the genital stage this stage begins at the age of eleven lasts through puberty and ends when one reaches adulthood at the age of eighteen the onset of puberty reflects a strong interest from one person to another of the opposite sex if one does not experience fixation in any of the psychosexual stages once he or she has reached the genital stage he or she will grow into a well balanced human being freud proposed a set of defense mechanisms in one s body these set of defense mechanisms occur so one can hold a favorable or preferred view of themselves for example in a particular situation when an event occurs that violates one s preferred view of themselves freud states that it is necessary for the self to have some mechanism to defend itself against this unfavorable event this is known as defense mechanisms freud s work on defense mechanisms focuses on how the ego defends itself against internal events or impulses which are regarded as unacceptable to one s ego these defense mechanisms are used to handle the conflict between the id the ego and the superego freud noted that a major drive for people is the reduction of tension and the major cause of tension was anxiety he identified three types of anxiety reality anxiety neurotic anxiety and moral anxiety reality anxiety is the most basic form of anxiety and is based on the ego it is typically based on the fear of real and possible events for example being bit by a dog or falling off of a roof neurotic anxiety comes from an unconscious fear that the basic impulses of the id will take control of the person leading to eventual punishment from expressing the id s desires moral anxiety comes from the superego it appears in the form of a fear of violating values or moral codes and appears as feelings like guilt or shame when anxiety occurs the mind s first response is to seek rational ways of escaping the situation by increasing problem solving efforts and a range of defense mechanisms may be triggered these are ways that the ego develops to help deal with the id and the superego defense mechanisms often appear unconsciously and tend to distort or falsify reality when the distortion of reality occurs there is a change in perception which allows for a lessening in anxiety resulting in a reduction of tension one experiences sigmund freud noted a number of ego defenses which were noted throughout his work his daughter anna freud developed and elaborated on them the defense mechanisms are as follows these defenses are not under our conscious control and our unconscious will use one or more to protect one s self from stressful situations they are natural and normal without these neurosis develops such as anxiety states phobias obsessions or hysteria sigmund freud was born to jewish parents in a heavily roman catholic town freud desired to understand religion and spirituality and deals with the nature of religious beliefs in many of his books and essays he regards god as an illusion based on the infantile need for a powerful father figure freud believed that religion was an expression of underlying psychological neuroses and distress in some of his writing he suggests that religion is an attempt to control the oedipal complex as he goes on to discuss in his book totem and taboo in freud published the book totem and taboo this book was an attempt to reconstruct the birth and the process of development of religion as a social institution he wanted to demonstrate how the study of psychoanalysis is important in the understanding of the growth of civilization this book is about how the oedipus complex and incest taboo came into being and why they are present in all human societies the incest taboo rises because of a desire for incest the purpose of the totemic animal is not for group unity but to re enforce the incest taboo the totemic animal is not a symbol of god but a symbol of the father and it is an important part of religious development totemism originates from the memory of an event in pre history where the male group members eat the father figure due to a desire for the females the guilt they feel for their actions and for the loss of a father figure leads them to prohibit incest in a new way totemism is a means of preventing incest and as a ritual reminder of murder of the father this shows that sexual desire since there are many social prohibitions on sexual relations is channeled through certain ritual actions and all societies adopt these rituals so that sexuality develops in approved ways this reveals unconscious desires and their repression freud believes that civilization makes people unhappy because it contradicts the desire for progress freedom happiness and wealth civilization requires repression of drives and instincts such as sexual aggression and death instincts in order for civilization can work according to freud religion originated in pre historic collective experiences that became repressed and ritualized as totems and taboos he states that most if not all religions can be traced back to early human sacrifice including christianity in which christ on the cross is a symbolic representation of killing the father and eating the father figure this is shown with the body of christ also known as communion in this work freud attributes the origin of religion to emotions such as hatred fear and jealousy these emotions are directed towards the father figure in the clan from the sons who are denied sexual desires towards the females freud attributed totem religions to be a result of extreme emotion rash action and the result of guilt the psychopathology of everyday life is one of the most important books in psychology it was written by freud in and it laid the basis for the theory of psychoanalysis the book contains twelve chapters on forgetting things such as names childhood memories mistakes clumsiness slips of the tongue and determinism of the unconscious freud believed that there were reasons that people forget things like words names and memories he also believed that mistakes in speech now referred to as freudian slips were not accidents but instead the dynamic unconscious revealing something meaningful freud suggests that our everyday psychopathology is a minor disturbance of mental life which may quickly pass away freud believed all of these acts to have an important significance the most trivial slips of the tongue or pen may reveal people s secret feelings and fantasies pathology is brought into the everyday life which freud points out through dreams forgetfulness and parapraxes he uses these things to make his case for the existence of an unconscious that refuses to be explained or contained by consciousness freud explains how the forgetting of multiple events in our everyday life can be consequences of repression suppression denial displacement and identification defense mechanisms occur to protects one s ego so in the psychopathology of everyday life freud states painful memories merge into motivated forgetting which special ease p freud wrote three essays on the theory of sexuality sometimes titled three contributions to the theory of sex in it explores and analyzes his theory of sexuality and its presence throughout childhood freud s book describes three main topics in reference to sexuality sexual perversions childhood sexuality and puberty his first essay in this series is called the sexual aberrations this essay focuses on the distinction between a sexual object and a sexual aim a sexual object is the object that one desires while the sexual aim is the acts that one desires to perform with the object freud s second essay was explained infantile sexuality during this essay he insists that children have sexual urges the psychosexual stages are the steps a child must take in order to continue having sexual urges once adulthood is reached the third essay freud wrote described the transformation of puberty in this essay he examines how children express their sexuality throughout puberty and how sexual identity is formed during this time frame freud ultimately attempted to link unconscious sexual desires to conscious actions in each of his essays the interpretation of dreams is one sigmund freud s greatest published works known to date because of the stage it set for his psychoanalytic work during therapy sessions freud would ask his patients to talk about whatever would first come to their mind usually their responses directly related to a dream he then began to analyze their dreams believing that this gave him access to their deepest thoughts he also believed he could find links between his patients current hysterical behaviors and past traumatic experiences from here he began to formulate a book to allow others to understand dream interpretation by using his current theory of the unconscious freud believed that dreams were messages from the unconscious masked as wishes controlled by internal stimuli the unconscious mind plays the most imperative role in dream interpretation in order to remain in a state of sleep the unconscious mind has to detain negative thoughts and represent them in an edited form therefore when one dreams the unconscious makes an effort to deal with any conflict freud categorized dreams into different levels in order to better understand the unconscious as the primary standard for dream interpretation the first level of dreams is the manifest content which is the dream one remembers after waking up but freud believed no attention should be given to this level because the unconscious mind produced the dream into a different meaning from its original latent content is the second level of dreams which is the real dream amongst your unconscious thoughts this is where the true meaning of the dream lies and turned into another sense to protect ourselves in order for our dreams to convert from latent content to manifest content four steps are required condensation displacement symbolism and secondary revision a special focus on symbolism was emphasized in interpretation freud believed that dreams are highly symbolic with an underlying principle meaning most of the symbolic stages focuses on sexually connotation for example a tree branch could represent a part of the male genitals he also believed all human behavior originated from our sexual drives and desires", " in psychology frustration is a common emotional way to act when things go wrong it is a feeling of being angry and sad when something one wants or wishes for does not happen in physics frustration or geometrical frustration is a property of water molecules in ice when a freezing crystal is formed the presence of random or conflicting atoms stop the ice from being completely frozen it is called water ice", " in social psychology fundamental attribution error is the phenomenon where people judge other people and themselves in a different way the person tends to judge other people s good behavior as them having a good personality and the person also judges other people s bad behavior as them having a bad personality the error comes from the fact that the person judges themselves on the context or situation and not on personality this can lead people to assume others are bad people instead of them making a mistake an example of this error would be if we had a person who we will name alice alice is a driver bob goes in front of her and alice assumes he has bad personal qualities such as being selfish being a bad driver or being a jerk however there are possible explanations that are related to context instead of personal qualities bob could have almost missed his flight or his wife could be giving birth at the hospital if she goes in front of someone else she will likely make the opposite mistake and explain her behavior as situational instead of being a personal flaw this is still the same error because it is an attribution placement that is wrong", " gaslighting is a type of psychological abuse where somebody uses lies or tricks to make another person doubt their memory and mental health gaslighting can be anything from an abusive person insisting that the abuse never happened to setting up strange incidents to confuse the victim the word gaslighting comes from the play by patrick hamilton gas light and its movie adaptations in those works a character uses many tricks including turning the gas lamps lower than normal to convince his spouse that she is crazy since then the phrase has become a common expression which has also been used in clinical and research literature", " gender dysphoria is a term used by psychologists and physicians it describes people who strongly feel they are not the gender they were born with it used to be called gender identity disorder it is a condition accompanied by stress anxiety and depression to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria now patients must show strong cross gender feelings that persist over time it is not just a desire to change sex for some advantage they might think exists people with gender dysphoria are often transgender they take steps to help their gender dysphoria a step they could take is to take testosterone or estrogen transgender women take estrogen transgender men take testosterone for children puberty blockers may be taken instead they can also get surgery one surgery for transgender men is removal to get rid of breasts this makes the chest flat the flat chest makes them happy because they look more like a man another surgery for both transgender men and transgender women is genital reconstruction surgery this means they can get a penis or a vulva gender dysphoria may cause many to become alone but not by choice it often leads to avoiding or dropping out of school feminine speech patterns and ways of acting are common in people who were born male with gender dysphoria teenagers in particular are at risk of suicide the world health organization who renamed gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria in the dsm renamed it in the american psychiatric association gives a diagnosis of gender dysphoria in teenagers or adults if they feel two or more of these feelings to be diagnosed the person must have enough distress about their feelings different studies find different numbers of people with gender dysphoria in a new zealand study of people responded yes to a question asking if they thought they were transgender a study in massachusetts found that of adults say they are transgender", " gestalt therapy is a form of psychotherapy it is a way of treating people who feel ill at ease it is based on the idea that it is best to experience what we feel here and now and not keep thinking about the past or worry about the future the goal is to help clients become aware of his or her thoughts behaviours experiences and feelings and to own or take responsibility for them it forms part of what is called humanistic psychology and was co founded by fritz perls laura perls and paul goodman in the s s at the center of gestalt therapy is the idea of awareness knowing the person being helped is encouraged to know his or her own feelings and behaviour and the effect they have upon the world around them with gestalt therapy the patient is helped to see that they are trying to avoid feeling emotions from the present once the patient realizes this he or she can begin to get better", " a hallucination is seeing hearing tasting smelling or feeling things that do not really exist usually people have to be awake and conscious to have hallucinations that way a person who sees or hears something that is not really there has a hallucination hallucinations are different from dreams when people dream they are not awake hallucinations are also different from illusions illusions are based on real perceptions which are distorted or interpreted in a wrong way certain drugs can cause hallucinations some illegal drugs are taken because they cause hallucinations certain mental illnesses can also cause hallucinations in some cases withdrawal of a drug can also cause hallucinations this has especially been reported by people trying to stop taking sleeping pills or by alcoholics people who have hallucinations are not necessarily ill lack of sleep can also cause hallucinations hallucinations just before going to sleep or just after waking up are considered normal hallucinations can affect all of a person s senses people with the mental illness of schizophrenia may hear sounds or voices that are not really there people with certain mental illnesses may also have hallucinations in which they see a person or thing which is not really there people are less likely to have hallucinations in which they smell or touch something that is not really there certain forms of epilepsy can cause hallucinations finally hallucinations can be the result of certain substances taken or of certain physical constellations most of the time these substances are taken to get the hallucinations sometimes severe lack of sleep or high fever can lead to hallucinations brought on by such viruses as the common cold many studies have shown hallucinatory experiences take place across the world several studies one of them done as early as have reported that approximately of the population experience hallucinations a recent survey of over people reported a much higher figure according to the study almost of the people reported hallucinatory experiences of the people reported daytime hallucinations mostly outside the context of illness or drug use from this survey hallucinations affecting smell or taste seem the most common in the general population some diseases such as brain disorders or infections may cause a person to have hallucinations as well an alcoholic person who is addicted to alcohol who stops drinking alcohol suddenly may experience a type of hallucinations called delirium tremens or dt s some people have hallucinations if they do not sleep for a number of days or if they do not eat for a number of days some people have hallucinations because they purposefully or accidentally put chemicals or drugs into their bodies some people use illegal drugs that cause vivid hallucinations such as lsd acid and pcp angel dust many kinds of drugs even legal ones will cause hallucinations if very large doses are taken and it is seen as a side effect some legal drugs that dentists doctors or surgeons use cause hallucinations the dentists doctors and surgeons use drugs called anaesthetics to make people not feel pain or to make people become unconscious but the drugs also have some other additional effects which are called side effects such as nausea feeling sick and hallucinations many dentists use an anaesthetic called nitrous oxide laughing gas inhaling large quantities of nitrous oxide can cause people to have hallucinations doctors and surgeons use many types of anaesthetic gases so that patients who are being operated become unconscious when a person inhales anaesthetic gases they may have hallucinations for several minutes until they become unconscious some adults accidentally swallow a poisonous chemical because it is in a bottle that has the wrong label in some cases children swallow a poisonous chemical because they think that it is a food product or a drink some dangerous poisonous chemicals which can make people very sick or even kill them also cause hallucinations some people have hallucinations when they have not slept for a long time other people have

control they are unable to learn from experience or mistakes in life since they lack any sense of past or future and are not able to genuinely care about other people people with haltlose are also called an unstable psychopath it is studied in psychiatry sociology and criminology and is one of the most common types of psychopathy to end up committing crimes including violence and murder healthier individuals may still focus on either vengeance or sadism parents with haltlose make up the majority of those who sexually molest their own children the disorder has many things in common with anti social personality disorder and borderline personality disorder bpd in some countries doctors diagnose bpd to describe two sets of behaviors but doctors in other countries diagnose the one group as bpd and the other group as haltlose or some people might have both usually people with haltlose will also have other mental illnesses such as histrionic personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder or fantasy prone personality sometimes doctors will make a mistake and think it is bipolar it can also look likeepilepsy if combined with alcoholism it can be very difficult for a doctor to help them become better since they tend to lie to doctors because they are afraid and their pathological lying can be convincing even though they view it similar to a child and often believe they should be rewarded for having taken the time to invent such a good lie of all the different types of psychiatric patients those with haltlose personality disorder have some of the worst results the haltlose will usually need boundaries and controls set by those around them and optimistic professionals suggest that marriage to a spouse willing to curtail their behaviors may be sufficient to avoid professional involvement their symptoms get worse if they are given independence whether at home work or in a prison or hospital the name is based on a german word haltlos which means without stability in this context it is used for an irresponsible and unstable lifestyle it appears in the icd book but not in the dsm v book like other personality disorders nobody is certain what causes it there appears to be both genetic and environmental causes and although it is difficult to identify in children by adolescence it is typically easy to diagnose it is believed to be caused by the mother not the father both from her own health and also from how she treated the child when they were young it is equally common in males and females and doctors must be careful not to wrongly identify a child as haltlose since many of the symptoms are actually normal for children such as selfishness lack of planning and feigning emotions they see others having and they only suggest a mental illness if they continue at later ages professionals disagree on whether the haltlose are actually unable to understand the difference between good and evil or if they understand but do not care or if they deliberately choose evil instead of good usually people with haltlose personality disorderstop showing their symptoms almost immediately if they are in a controlled environment like the army or a psychiatric hospital or prison dr l scholz anomale kinder berlin people with haltlose personality disorder have primitive reactions to things and their largest focus is simply on their own survival they frequently struggle with addictions such as with drugs or alcohol and are one of two types of personality disorders that commit the most crimes they also tend to have abnormal sexual habits such as bdsm homosexuality or increased masturbation they do struggle with addictions most commonly with alcoholism they often consume drugs coffee tea or medicines in larger quantities than normal because they spend so much money they usually have large debts they cannot pay and either ask family to pay ignore or attempt crime theft prostitution etc to pay their debts however many professionals suggest that parents and spouses do not pay such debts and instead let the haltlose person s bad decisions lead them to institutionalization where they will be healthier and have more guidance although they often threaten or pretend to commit suicide suicide pacts or murder suicide they do not commonly actually do it since they are easily distracted and made happy again often their reason for pretending is because they are scared of an approaching consequence for their actions of even because they like the excitement of police and hospitals becoming involved lobotomy was tested as a possible means to limit their chaotic thinking it can be very difficult for people to understand them because they can have a number of endearing qualities such as appearing naturally charming plausible likable or emotionally warm but they are actually using those as tools to conquer the people watching them usually they do not like science or religion as they control and limit the answers often they are very good at arts like acting in theatres their lack of memory means that they can easily play new characters and feel very similar to the character they are playing some have said that haltlose patient should be sterilized to prevent them from having children since they are not able to make decisions that would be good for anyone except themselves and they can become family tyrants while pretending to be victims sometimes governments have even refused them marriage licenses out of fear that marriage would lead to them having children even when they are not true pedophiles the haltlose demonstrate an increased risk of sexually molesting children with as many as of incestuous adult child molestors being haltlose mothers with haltlose may push their young daughters to engage in sex with men that the mother wishes she could have herself they also like to have sex with their own partners in front of the children rather than hiding the details of their sex life because they can

positive and responsible and talk about large plans that they intend to accomplish but they are actually very depressed and cynical most of the time because they are unable to make their plans work since they cannot learn from their mistakes and they do not have a good sense of time they will very quickly change from acting very confident and brave to very sad angry or afraid when their plans do not work a major source of the problem is that they are not able to remember the past or think about the future so every decision is decided only on the basis of the present time similarly if asked to describe themselves they cannot accurately describe things they felt in the past because they only know the story they are telling right now because they are not capable of planning for the future and make very bad choices doctors often decide they need leaders and controls to guide them in every aspect of life this means they can be very successful when they are in a hospital prison or school with very strict rules and leadership because their intelligence is normal it is just their personality disorder that leads them to trouble some professionals say the haltlose do not understand warnings so only punishments work to stop them from doing bad things but other professionals say that they do not learn any long term lessons from punishment when they feel guilty about something they become overwhelmed with the fear that there will be consequences or punishment so they often exaggerate or invent untruthful stories to blame other people and will pretend that they are a victim or being exploited or held prisoner they will often pretend to be embarrassed experience regret or to be submissive even though these things are not usually real for haltlose personalities this makes it troublesome for doctors trying to help them when they feel guilty about doing something that has not been noticed yet they become overwhelmed with the fear that there will be consequences or punishment so they often begin to exaggerate or invent untruthful stories to blame other people and will pretend that they are a victim or being exploited or held prisoner once caught the less intelligent haltlose will respond by claiming that their childhood was not good and that current friends or relatives have misled them and caused them to do these bad things the more intelligent haltlose will instead invent elaborate stories with a lot of false details to misdirect attention from what they have done", " harm is physical or psychological or emotional damage or injury to a

very easily affected by things they are said to have a high sensitivity or innate sensitiveness as carl gustav jung originally called it according to some researchers highly sensitive people are about one fifth of the population they process sensory data much more deeply and thoroughly because their nervous systems are biologically different this is a specific trait with key effects that have often been confused with shyness inhibitedness fearfulness introversion as well as other effects the existence of innate sensitivity was shown using a test source the term is mainly used to describe humans but may also describe animals", " human nature refers to the characteristics of mankind this means ways of thinking feeling and acting which humans have naturally what these characteristics are what causes them and how fixed human nature is are good questions they among the oldest and most important questions in western philosophy these questions affect ethics politics and theology human nature is a source of advice on how to live well but it also puts limits and obstacles on living a good life the complex implications of such questions are also dealt with in art and literature while the humanities inquire into human nature and what it means to be human many great thinkers have had definite ideas on human nature but some ideas have lasted better than others an example of this is the best selling college textbook which first appeared in as seven theories of human nature the seven theories were those of thirty years later the selection was of ten theories aristotle plato s most famous student made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature in his works some clear statements about human nature are made for aristotle reason is what is most special about humanity compared to other animals and is what we achieve at our best much of aristotle s description of human nature is still influential today but the particular teleological idea that humans are meant or intended to be something has become much less popular in modern times humans are mammals and have developed by a process of evolution it follows that what is called human nature is inherited and had been the product of natural selection we are not blank slates our mental life and behaviour has ancient roots this is the question of nature vs nurture and the subject matter of evolutionary psychology ethology and sociobiology has also looked at these issues from the perspective of human evolution and heredity", " hypnosis is a trance state characterized by extreme suggestibility relaxation and heightened imagination it is an altered state of consciousness usually one person the hypnotist talks to another the subject in a special way that puts the subject into a trance while the subject is in this state he can be influenced by suggestions the hypnotist can tell him to forget his name or that the room is hot he will start sweating or that he is someone else hypnotic suggestions may be delivered by a hypnotist in the presence of the subject or may be self administered self suggestion or autosuggestion the use of hypnotism for therapeutic purposes is referred to as hypnotherapy while its use as a form of entertainment for an audience is known as stage hypnosis contrary to a popular misconception that hypnosis is a form of unconsciousness resembling sleep some contemporary research suggests that hypnotic subjects are fully awake and are focusing attention with a corresponding decrease in their peripheral awareness subjects also show an increased response to suggestions however the behaviour of subjects under hypnotism goes so far beyond normal focused attention that the description of altered state of consciousness is more used hypnotherapy is when a hypnotist uses hypnosis to help the subject heal emotionally or to heal a sick mind hypnotherapy is hypnosis used for therapy hypnosis can also be done by one person acting alone then he is acting as both hypnotist and subject this is called self hypnosis or sometimes auto suggestion in some cases this is simply a form of using trance almost every pre modern society had practices which were somewhat like hypnotism often a special person in a society witchdoctor shaman priest would conduct a ceremony the ceremony might use incantations spells chants repetitive music mind altering substances darkness fire and other settings the purpose was to send a person or group into an altered state of mind like a trance even literate societies such as ancient greece had phenomena suggestive of hypnosis the delphic oracle was in a trance of some kind as she uttered her famous predictions whether that was self hypnosis or just the effects of volcanic gas will never be known there seem to be many ideas about how hypnosis started historic records in modern europe start with the work of franz mesmer though he did not invent the word hypnotism mesmer and his followers practised what was first called animal magnetism and later mesmerism descriptions of his work leave no doubt that he had discovered for himself what we now call hypnotism the words hypnosis and hypnotism both derive from the term neuro hypnotism nervous sleep coined by the scottish surgeon james braid around braid based his practice on that developed by but differed in his theory as to how the procedure worked the main hypnosis discoveries came in when braid started to learn more about its effects he did not think that mesmerism was the cause of hypnosis and in the end he thought that trances were only a nervous sleep in he wrote a book about this with the title neurypnology in this book braid described hypnotism as a state of physical relaxation accompanied and induced by mental concentration abstraction hypnosis is used to treat fears addictions emotional trouble pain control stress and so on the hypnotist must do two things to do hypnosis first he must put the subject into a trance second he must lead the subject through the trance process for therapy or whatever effect is needed often he will switch between these first making sure the subject is in the proper state of mind and then leading him through the process these steps are repeated in a cycle throughout in trance the subject does not make decisions about the truth of the hypnotist s suggestions if trance is reached it is not always the subject will accept as true anything the hypnotist says unless it goes against the subject s deepest beliefs this is the heart of hypnosis to put the subject in trance so he will accept suggestions stage hypnotists get truly amazing effects from good subjects they can make them forget their names believe they are someone else make them see people who are not there make them forget letters or numbers and so on this happens because the subject actively follows the hypnotist s suggestions because he trusts the hypnotist and he believes it is safe if the trust is broken or the subject believes it is not safe the subject may emerge from trance hypnosis is not truly a power resting in the hypnotist instead the power rests in the mind of the subject the hypnotist simply knows how to guide the subject through trance", " the hypostatic model of personality is a way of viewing the many sides of a person s character the model says that a person can behave and appear to others in many ways depending on how that person is but also on how someone looks at that person it says that people are not one sided but are a little bit of everything for example today someone can be mean and tomorrow he can be good how someone appears also depends on things and people around him or her for example sometimes the most coward person may become the greatest hero if he is called to save someone s life all these sides of a person have to be known by scientists so they can change them for the better", " the id ego and super ego are ideas created by sigmund freud they are three concepts used to explain the way the human mind works freud describes the human mind as interaction of id ego super ego the ego and to some extent the super ego is conscious or on the surface the id remains unconscious together they make up the personality according to this model of the psyche the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends the ego is the organized realistic part and the super ego plays the critical and moralising role the id ego and super ego are functions of the mind not parts of the brain they do not correspond one to one with actual structures of the kind dealt with by neuroscience the id represents a constant in the personality as it is always present the id is governed by the pleasure principle early in the development of his theory freud saw sexual energy as the only source of energy for the id after the tragedy of world war i however freud felt it necessary to add another instinct to the id so he proposed thanatos the death instinct thanatos accounts for the instinctual violent urges of humankind obviously the rest of the personality would have somehow to deal with these two instincts by adding thanatos he could describe more mental phenomena his idea of id had wide influence the id is unconscious by definition the ego is the sense of self and the surface of the personality the part you usually show the world the ego is governed by the reality principle or a practical approach to the world it seeks to turn the id s drive to behaviour which brings benefits in the long term rather than grief conscious awareness resides in the ego although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious the ego separates out what is real it helps us to organise our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us but the ego serves three severe masters the external world the super ego and the id its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super ego thus the ego driven by the id confined by the super ego repulsed by reality struggles in bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it and readily breaks out in anxiety the super ego aims for perfection and the ideal outcome it comprises that part of the personality mainly unconscious which includes the individual s ego ideals spiritual goals and the psychic agency commonly called conscience that criticises and prohibits his or her drives fantasies feelings and actions the superego consists of two parts the conscience and the ego ideal the conscience is the familiar metaphor of angel and devil on each shoulder the conscience decides what course of action one should take the ego ideal is an idealized view of one s self comparisons are made between the ego ideal and one s actual behavior both parts of the super ego develop through experience with others or via social interactions according to freud a strong super ego serves to inhibit the biological instincts of the id while a weak super ego gives in to the id s urgings further the levels of guilt in the two cases above will be high and low respectively", " idiot is a word used to describe someone who is stupid the adjective is idiotic the noun idiocy describes the state of being idiotic the word can be used in different ways today idiot is often used to show that someone has done something which was not very clever the word fool is similar to idiot but it is not as strong in the history of drama a fool was a jester someone who made people laugh kings often had jesters in real life a court jester had the job of making the king feel happy when he was sad jesters often pretended to be stupid but were actually very clever there are jesters and fools in a lot of shakespeare s plays the word simple can also be similar to idiot someone who is simple is a person who is not very clever or streetwise they are na ve and can easily be made to believe things because they are kind and expect everyone else to be kind as well such people are often called simpletons idiots or simpletons are commonly used in literature in german literature and in wagner s opera parsifal is described as perfect fool because he does not understand the evil ways of the world and is therefore completely good that is why he can break the magic spell cast by klingsor the idiot often appears in russian literature because the idiot is so simple he it is always a male is often able to express the truth which other people cannot see dostoevsky wrote a novel called the idiot it is about a man who is simple and trusting at the end of the opera boris godunov by mussorgsky the crowd of poor people gather round the simpleton who is the last person to sing in the whole opera his moans express the fact that russia will continue to be ruled by cruel

mind that they are not experiencing at the moment or that is not really happening imagination is a way to have fun imagination can also cause distress", " imposter syndrome is a bias in thinking in which the individual believes all of their accomplishments to be the result of coincidence and luck instead of actual skill this is often combined with the fear of being revealed as a fraud or imposter who does not deserve the things they have obtained in life people experiencing the imposter syndrome feel they do not belong in their environment because they think others know more and can do things better this often happens in relation to studying or work but can also apply to personal relationships with other people in the case of relationships with other people those with imposter syndrome worry that they are not good at what they do as well they believe they are not a good partner colleague or friend and that they have tricked others into liking them imposter syndrome is also feeling colleagues and authorities value you more than they should praise when someone says you did well often results in being shocked and not believing in what is said about you another trait is thinking your achievements and success are effects of luck mistakes or bias that is why these do not convince people that they are intelligent and still cause them to believe they do not deserve to be where they are these people often refer to themselves as impostors impostors worry that someone else will discover their true nature this would have negative effects like losing a job or others trust to avoid this they try to prevent anyone from finding out those with impostor syndrome have a high chance of also being perfectionists this means they wish to do everything without errors they also very often procrastinate put off things to do for later because when they do whether they succeed or fail they can think it was because of good or bad luck the clinical symptoms associated with imposter syndrome include anxiety fear of failure depression decreased mental health lower self esteem feelings of guilt and humiliation and frustration the imposter syndrome has also been found to be linked to some traits from the big five personality traits negativity depression and anxiety are common in both neuroticism one of the big five character traits and imposter phenomenon the two are then highly linked together people with imposter syndrome have low conscientiousness another big five character trait because of low self self esteem and low feeling of competence being able to do things successfully some people are more likely to experience imposter syndrome these include some researchers say women experience feeling like an impostor more often than men but others say they experience it equally frequently the ones that agree have found that women on average believe they are able to successfully do tasks less than men when they do succeed they think it is because of external not relating to them directly causes like luck when they fail women think it is because they do not have the necessary abilities with men it is the opposite case when they succeed they think it is because of internal directly related to them causes like being smart and their abilities however when they fail they blame it on bad luck or the task being too hard other researchers have found that men are less likely than women to accept and deal with imposter syndrome they feel the need to have a typical man s job like a mechanic or engineer and not the ones assumed to be more of a woman s job like a nurse or teacher having an imposter syndrome they avoid feeling different and without talent or abilities in the more woman typical job they would rather pick a job where they will not differ as much many things have been suggested to be done to reduce the feelings of being an imposter", " incest means sexual intercourse between people who are closely related usually this means members of the same family in many societies it is forbidden by law and religion which relatives it is forbidden to have sex with depends on the law religion and culture if pregnancy is a risk there may be reasons based on health children that result from incest between blood relatives are more likely to have birth defects the exact definition of the incest relationship varies in some societies it is immediate relations such as parents and their children or brothers and sisters of the same parents it sometimes includes extended family like aunts nephews nieces and uncles that way intercourse between cousins is legally permitted in the large majority of the world but is disliked in many countries in some u s states such as texas the legal definition of incest includes first cousins but not second cousins a person who engages in incest is called an incestophile or incestualist other societies define it much more widely to include all blood relatives or all who live in the same household or belong to the same clan some religions say that sex between people related by marriage is incest for example the old testament forbids sex between siblings in law in south africa sex between a parent in law and child in law is illegal the type of incest most often reported in the western world is father daughter incest incest between adults and children is a form of child sexual abuse this form has been shown to cause one of the worst forms of childhood trauma a trauma that often causes serious and long term psychological damage especially in the case of parental incest stepparents are more likely to abuse stepchildren than biological parents are to abuse their children because people typically care about their own children more than they care about their stepchildren the cinderella effect it is suggested that the westermarck effect prevents a person being attracted to anyone whom he lived in the same house as during his childhood hence most people are never sexually attracted to their siblings or parents the term is often used to apply to less serious sexual relationships between related people it is difficult to say how frequent incest is but researchers have estimated that between and of people have at least one incest experience this means some kind of sexual relationship falling short of actual incest less than of these involve intercourse or attempted intercourse among women research by russell and wyatt has given estimates as high as twenty percent for such incest experience in a survey of women in san francisco of those who had grown up with a stepfather in said that he sexually abused her in the same study in of the women said that they had been sexually abused by their father cousincest refers to incest with a cousin siblingcest refers to incest with a sibling incest between consenting adults is very rare or rarely reported willing incest between adults is a crime in most countries it is seen by some as a victimless crime a reason why it is prohibited is because severely handicapped children are often born to parents who are blood related other reasons for it being illegal are religion and to try to prevent sexual predation most societies have some form of incest avoidance the incest taboo is and has been one of the most common of all cultural taboos both in current nations and many past societies with legal penalties imposed in some jurisdictions most modern societies have legal or social restrictions on closely consanguineous marriages however in some societies such as that of ancient egypt brother sister father daughter and mother son relations were practiced among royalty in addition the balinese and some inuit tribes have altogether different beliefs about what constitutes illegal and immoral incest", " animals with nervous systems are born with instincts an instinct is a part of the behaviour of an organism it is inherited innate not learned however the term does not include the operation of sense organs and does not include the normal working of the autonomic nervous system instincts are to do with visible muscular action in response to releasers releasers are triggers which set off chains of instinctive behaviour although instincts are not learned in some cases their performance can be improved by experience and practice there are some problems with the term instinct it can be used loosely to mean a general tendency such as a man s instinct is to protect his family it can be used to describe chains of behaviour of mixed origin properly it is used only of well defined acts whose causation is inherited and which are triggered by specific stimuli called releasers other terms for instinct are fixed action patterns fap and innate behaviour chains instinctive behaviours can be variable and responsive to the environment any behaviour is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience that is in the absence of learning sea turtles newly hatched on a beach will automatically move toward the ocean and automatically swim when they are in the water a joey climbs into its mother s pouch upon being born honeybees communicate by dance the direction of a food source without formal instruction other examples include animal fighting animal courtship behaviour internal escape functions and building of nests reflex actions are a special case a true reflex is distinguished from other behaviours by mechanism they do not go through the brain rather the stimulus travels to the spinal cord and the message is then transmitted back through the body tracing a path called the reflex arc reflexes are similar to fixed action patterns but a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well a male stickleback s instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example examples of instinctive behaviours in humans include many of the primitive reflexes such as rooting and suckling behaviours which are present in most mammals some instinctive behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear for instance we commonly refer to birds learning to fly because they cannot fly at first but can a week or two later however young birds have been experimentally reared in devices that prevent them from moving their wings until they reached the age at which their cohorts were flying these birds flew immediately and normally when released showing that their improvement resulted from neuromuscular maturation and not true learning while fixed action patterns and reflexes are clear examples of almost entirely instinctive behaviours most behaviours are complex and consist of both instinctive and learned components for instance in imprinting a bird has a sensitive period during which it learns who its mother is konrad lorenz famously had a goose imprint on his boots thereafter the goose would follow whomever wore the boots the identity of the goose s mother was learned but the goose s behavior towards the boots was instinctive similarly sleeping in humans is instinctive but how much and when one sleeps is clearly subject to environmental factors whether a behaviour is instinctive or learned is common subject of nature versus nurture debates in a situation when two instincts contradict each other an animal may resort to a displacement activity instinct is a built in need to do something it s not something an animal thinks about it s something it does automatically a baby bird automatically throws its head back opens its mouth wide and screams for food it is an instinct baby bats automatically cling to the cave wall grasshoppers naturally spit out the things in their stomach on predators that try to eat them bees naturally work to take care of the hive and make honey butterflies inherit preferences for laying their eggs on certain plants plant their young need to eat and that s where they lay their eggs animals are born with these instincts and they follow their instincts without conscious thought organisms have two ways they can get behaviours one way is learn by observation and by repeating things which have a pleasant outcome the other way is to inherit the behaviour pattern by heredity", " introversion and extraversion is a personality dimension it was promoted by carl jung in the s individual people differ on this scale introverts are quiet and shy and extraverts are loud and sociable according to the theory introverts get energy from inside themselves ideas and concepts in their own minds and extroverts get energy from outside of themselves interacting with other people there are many concepts or understanding about introversion and extroversion that are false or myths such as the idea that introverts are not talkative and live their lives emotionless the idea of introversion and extraversion has been used in many personality tests and is an important factor those who follow this way of looking at the world say that everyone has some parts of both traits in them though one will usually dominate over the other at one time extroverts were thought to make up almost three fourths of american society now researchers typically assume that the number of extroverts is pretty much equal to the number of introverts in the country ", " islamophobia is a political term and a slur used against people critical of islam it literally

abuse isolating the victim from the outside world is important to get psychological control over the victim isolation reduces the opportunity of the victim to be rescued it will also make the victim

job they feel job satisfaction when an employee performs their work well they feel a sense of job satisfaction if a worker has good relationships with their boss and their coworkers they feel job satisfaction psychologists who study the behavior of industries and organizations also look at job satisfaction in different ways assessments of job satisfaction became commonplace in the s in r s uhrbrock was one of the first psychologists to use new techniques to assess factory worker attitudes in r hoppock published a study of teachers on how satisfied they were with their jobs this study found that job satisfaction is affected by the work the coworkers and the managers before the s not many job satisfaction studies were published many factors influence job satisfaction some factors are environmental they are particular to a situation they come from the work and the workplace in edwin a locke wrote about the factors that lead to satisfaction or dissatisfaction at work although this list was written in the th century many factors are the same in the st century also a person can feel satisfied with their job if they get a good evaluation of their work company policies for example about how employees are supervised can influence job satisfaction pay is another factor in job satisfaction achievement or recognition can also make a person feel job satisfaction opportunities for promotions to jobs with higher rank can increase job satisfaction one of the most important aspects of work in a modern organization is communication a communication load is the amount and the speed and the complexity of communication that a person has to process people can experience communication overload this is when they get too much information in too short a period of time or when they get information that is too complex to process in a short period of time people can also experience communication underload this is when they do not get enough information both communication overload and communication underload can affect the level of job satisfaction if a person receives too much communication or not enough communication on the job they are more likely to become dissatisfied and unhappy with their work this can lead to a low level of job satisfaction a study surveyed million employees in the united states according to the study the most important factors for job satisfaction are if a job has all of these factors people feel more satisfied and loyal to the company some factors in job satisfaction are personal or individual each person is affected in their own unique way moods and emotions at work are related to job satisfaction positive and negative emotions are related to overall job satisfaction genetics play a role in job satisfaction one scientific experiment studied twins who were raised apart researchers measured the influence of genetics on the twins job satisfaction the study found that of job satisfaction comes from the environment and comes from genetic factors some research shows a connection between personality and job satisfaction employees who do not feel alienated or left out have more job satisfaction employees who feel in control of their situation also have more job satisfaction they show more involvement in their job and more commitment to the company psychological well being pwb is how well a person s mind functions overall it involves every part of a person s life work family community etc pwb in the workplace plays an important role in determining job satisfaction and has attracted much research attention in recent years these studies focused on the effects of pwb on job satisfaction and job performance research published in showed a strong connection between pwb and job satisfaction a second study by the same authors in had similar results these studies showed that pwb predicts job performance better than job satisfaction does researchers have various ways to measure job satisfaction the job descriptive index measures job satisfaction in ways pay promotions coworkers bosses and the work itself the survey is simple people answer yes no or there are other job satisfaction surveys for example the job satisfaction survey and the faces scale the job satisfaction survey asks questions about factors in job satisfaction the faces scale asks only one question people answer by choosing a face", " the word judgment also spelled judgement means making a decision carefully after studying and comparing all evidence that is available a judgment may be about what is the best thing to do or how to do it or how to classify something or someone or what to think about something judgment may differ according to the topic", " knowledge of results is a term in the psychology of learning p a psychology dictionary defines it as feedback of information it describes the situation where a subject gets information which helps them to change behaviour in a desirable way or to gain understanding a primitive example is avoiding a behaviour after punishment an advanced example is the way a human may improve understanding and behaviour after a teacher explains what was wrong with the previous effort there are a number of similar terms in psychology but all of them have some problems so knowledge of results or sometimes immediate knowledge of results is a useful term it can be used for any learning where a student or any animal gets information after the action the information is about how satisfactory the action is an early experiment on knowledge of results was the machine invented by sidney pressey where a device both tested and taught multiple choice questions note that this method tells the user by inference only whether the choice was correct or not since the material was multiple choice items it was only intended as an addition to collecting classroom test scores later work in training research and education used the term knowledge of results frequently an important question was whether scores would be improved more if direct teaching was given either before or after the question was asked the answer in both cases was broadly yes using instructional films michael and maccoby split groups into two halves half the students were given material which required active explicit responses after a pause they were told the correct answer the other half was not given feedback instructional time was identical the result showed a slight but significant gain for the active response procedure without feedback but more gain when feedback was provided the experimenters later described this as kcr rather than feedback research on the active response itself is summarised in p later discussion of experiments like these suggested that the results might be due to practice rather than feedback undoubtedly the set up had given extra practice on the questions as well as knowledge of results in technical terms the experiments had confounded the two factors another factor is that knowledge of results may give information to the instructor as to ways the material can be improved using a teaching program on decimal arithmetic an experienced teacher can put student mistakes into types for example one group of mistakes are due to the learners not understanding the rules about placement of the point in decimal multiplication this shows where and how the learning material needs to be revised conscious thought is not necessary for knowledge of results to have its effect research on implicit learning shows that complex information can be got by humans without their awareness this is also shown by experiments on animal learning which show the effects of knowledge of results on later behaviour it seems likely that unconscious learning by results evolved first in early metazoa and conscious thought very much later this is what reber calls the primacy of the implicit meaning implicit unconscious learning came first in evolution", " the k bler ross model or the five stages of grief is a theory about the feelings of people who are dying the five stages are denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance the five

maslow says that these needs cause us to want or desire certain things he says that there are many other things that influence our behavior just because we may want something does not mean we will try to get it there could be something else in the way that causes us to act differently the physiological level of maslow s hierarchy includes basic human needs these include water breathing food and sleep the physiological level contains the simplest needs they are the most straightforward needs in the entire hierarchy the human body tries to stay balanced inside when a person is missing a physiological need the body will naturally want the missing need in simple creatures such as rodents physiological needs may be the only needs that have to be met however in humans this is only the base of the hierarchy after physiological needs are met there are four higher levels in the hierarchy people are often not aware when their physiological needs are being met however when these needs are not met it becomes very obvious for example most humans do not think about each inhale and exhale they take this satisfies their need to breathe however if the oxygen supply were cut off all people would immediately become aware of the need to breathe physiological needs are important from the time a person is born and throughout their entire life the safety level of maslow s hierarchy includes varying levels of safety these include safety of the self family resources jobs health and life both children and adults are very aware of their safety needs needs of safety are just as important as physiological needs however these needs deal more with the mind they include having a sense of safety in the world every person s sense of safety is different depending where they live adults much like children prefer the world to be organized this ensures a level of safety however some adults are too focused on organization people may also attempt to control the world around them in all ways possible adults may have their safety needs met in a different way than children adults can feel that the money they earn from their job allows them to feel safe this is because there is no need for financial worry when earning a steady income the love belonging level of maslow s hierarchy deals with various social needs these include a need for friendship family and other types of group inclusion love belonging also refers to personal relationships these include romantic relationships it is crucial that the physiological and safety needs of a person are met first then they can develop needs of love and belonging once basic needs are met then a person can focus on their social needs these needs change throughout the human lifespan if belonging needs are not met then a person may feel depressed the field of psychology focuses on this level of the hierarchy in modern society many people suffer because their needs of love and belonging are not met this level also deals with sexual and intimate needs sex may or may not be part of this level of need it can be considered necessary for love or it can be looked at as strictly physiological the esteem level is about how people need to feel that they play a part in the world people want to feel that they have accomplished things that are valuable and important they also want to feel independent meaning that they can do things for themselves and do not need to depend on anybody else we cannot be truly happy without becoming everything that we want to become people have different things that they might want in their life that go along with this level these needs do not show themselves until all of the needs in previous levels have been taken care of for example if a person is worrying about feeding themselves and needs to think about their physiological needs then they will not be thinking about self actualization and their life goals making sure they have food and a home is more important someone only reaches the self actualization level once all the other levels are fulfilled maslow explains that there are exceptions to the hierarchy the most important are maslow s hierarchy suggests that all human behavior is motivated however this may not be true some human behavior may simply be reflexive maslow holds a biased opinion on the definition of self actualization each individual may have a different opinion of what it means to self actualize maslow believed that people who self actualized had great characteristics he believed these made them natural leaders and incredible people this makes the goal of self actualization nearly impossible for the average person maslow s theory states that lower level needs must be met in order to meet needs in the higher levels however this is not always the case it is possible for people who suffer from poverty and hunger to still feel love and belonging therefore higher level needs can be met in some cases even if lower levels needs are neglected some theorists argue that the levels of the hierarchy are out of order in terms of necessity some needs that are higher in the hierarchy may actually appear and become important early in an infant or child s life maslow s hierarchy is hard to prove scientifically it cannot be proved false easily there may not be enough hard scientific evidence to fully support maslow s hierarchy an extensive review of research based on maslow s theory found little evidence for the ranking of needs that maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all the order in which the hierarchy is arranged has been criticized as being ethnocentric in turn hofstede s work has been criticized by others maslow s hierarchy does not tackle the difference between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in individualistic societies and those raised in collectivist societies the needs and drives of those in individualistic societies may be more self centered than those in collectivist societies they may focus on improving themselves in collectivist societies the needs of acceptance and community may outweigh the needs for freedom and individuality", " mass hysteria is a phenomenon when a large group of people share a common emotion this emotion can be positive such as people being euphoric at a rock concert or it can be negative like after a great person or statesman died it was first used by the quarteerly christian spectator in to describe an outbreak of cholera ", " the milgram experiment is the name for a number of controversial experiments in psychology they were done by stanley milgram in the s milgram wanted to find out how easy it was to get someone to follow orders even if the orders went against their conscience in his experiment a test subject was ordered by a scientist to inflict electric shocks on another person though the shocks were faked to his surprise most subjects did as they were told until the very end of the experiment though many found it difficult there have been many repetitions and variations of the experiment with similar results participants were told they would be helping out in a learning experiment the participant played the role of a teacher in which they had to ask questions to the learner every time the learner got a question wrong or failed to answer the teacher had to press a switch to give the learner an electric shock the voltage increased each time in the original version of the experiment the teacher and learner were in separate rooms but could talk to each other through the wall in fact the electric shocks were faked the learners were actually actors who only pretended to be in pain as the shocks increased their cries of pain grew louder they protested banged the wall and stopped answering the questions the shocks eventually reached levels that would have been deadly had they been real at this point the learner fell silent much was done to trick the subjects into thinking it was real when they arrived they were told that the actor was another volunteer and that the teacher and learner roles would be decided at random by drawing slips of paper in fact both slips of paper said teacher so the actor pretended to have picked learner the electric shock machine made buzzing noises and could give an actual mild shock of volts the teacher would try this out before the experiment began if at any time the subject teacher wanted to stop the experiment the experimenter had instructions on what to say to them these were known as verbal prods the prods the experimenter had to use were in this order there were a few other things the experimenter was allowed to say for example if the subject asked about whether the learner would be badly hurt the experimenter could say although the shocks may be painful there is no permanent tissue damage so please go on if the subject still wished to stop after the four main prods had been used the experiment was halted otherwise it was halted after the subject had given the maximum volt shock three times in succession before milgram did his experiment he asked fourteen yale university psychology students what they thought the results would be on average the students thought that of the teachers would give the biggest electric shock of volts in fact in milgram s first set of experiments percent of of participants gave the final massive volt shock and all gave a shock of at least volts milgram found that the teachers showed signs of stress and nervousness in the experiment signs of this included sweating trembling stuttering and groaning all of them stopped to question the experiment at some point most continued once they were reassured by the experimenter other psychologists did their own versions of milgram s experiment and found very similar results after repeating the original experiment milgram and other scientists tried different variations these included milgram wrote about the experiment in his book obedience to authority an experimental view it was published in milgram offered two theories other factors might partly explain the milgram experiments some researchers argued that the experiments do not fully answer the question as to why apparently normal people commit atrocities in wartime for example the subjects were being told that the shocks would cause no major harm to the learner whereas those who caused events like the holocaust knew full well that they were committing murder the experiment has been mentioned numerous times in pop culture in the graphic novel v for vendetta dr surridge said that he has lost faith in humanity because of the experiment in there was a conference about it at nipissing university in canada the milgram effect was mentioned in the movie i care a lot in passing", " the mind is a general term for the way a person that thinks reasons perceives wills and feels for science what others call the mind is entirely caused by workings of the brain the philosopher gilbert ryle called mind the ghost in the machine he said the idea that it was separate from the brain was the mistaken official doctrine however some think that mind is separate from the body and is called a soul see dualism many people argue about what makes up the mind some say that only reason and memory are part of the mind because they are conscious in this view the emotions like love hate fear and joy are different from the mind some people with this view say the emotions are part of the heart others argue that our rational and emotional states cannot be separated and should all be part of what we call the mind people often use mind to mean the same as thought the way we talk to ourselves inside our heads this is where the sayings make up our minds change our minds and of two minds come from one of the important things of the mind in this sense is that it is private no one else can know our mind the original meaning of the old english gemynd was memory this explains the sayings call to mind come to mind keep in mind to have mind of and so on old english had other words to express what we call mind today such as hyge meaning mind spirit the word mind gradually grew to mean all conscious thought over the th and th centuries thought is when we absorb what happens around us so that we can deal with it effectively according to our plans and desires thinking is using information like forming concepts problem solving reasoning and making choices memory is when we store information in our minds and can later recall it imagination is the ability to invent worlds inside the mind complete or not the mind makes these by drawing on experience in the shared world consciousness is knowing that we exist and the world exists and being able to understand what happens around us just like the body a mind can be healthy the measure of this is called mental health according to the world health organization who there is not one way to measure mental health in all people because there are many things in our environment that might make what is mentally healthy different from one person to another in general most experts agree that mental health and mental illness are not opposites in other words not having a mental illness does not mean you are in good mental health one way to study mental health is by looking at how well a person lives signs of mental health include feeling capable and happy being able to handle normal levels of stress making and keeping friends leading an independent life and being able to recover from difficult situations philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind and how it is linked to the body the main problem is how the mind is related to the body but there are also questions about the nature of the mind that do not talk about its relation to the physical body dualism and monism are the two main ways people try to solve the mind body problem dualism is when people believe that the mind and body are in some way separate from each other it can be traced back to plato aristotle and the samkhya and yoga schools of hindu philosophy but it was most precisely formulated by ren descartes in the th century monism is the belief that mind and body are not physiologically and ontologically distinct kinds of entities this view was first seen in western philosophy by parmenides in the th century bc and was later held by the th century rationalist baruch spinoza according to spinoza mind and body are two parts of a larger being idealists think that the mind is all that exists and that the outside world is actually made up by the mind physicalists think that everything can be expressed by what is physical neutral monists believe that everything can be either mental or physical depending how you see it for example a red spot on a wall is physical because it is an actual thing depending on the physical wall but it is mental because our brain responds to the colour the most common monisms in the th and st centuries have all been different kinds of physicalism including behaviorism psychology is the study of the way we think feel and act it involves the scientific study of processes such as perception cognition feelings personality as well as things around us that might affect the way we think from this study psychologists try to form rules for why we act the way we do psychology also includes using this knowledge to help solve problems of everyday life and treat mental health problems social psychology is the study of how we think feel and act in groups of other people most people who study social psychology are either psychologists or sociologists the phrase mind s eye refers to the ability to see things with the mind", " mind control also known as brainwashing coercive persuasion or thought control refers to the way some people have tried to control the beliefs and behaviours of others it is a process where a group or individual uses methods to persuade other to change their basic beliefs and values a group or individual may use unethical methods to persuade others to believe and do what the manipulator s want it often harms the person being manipulated the term has been applied to any tactic psychological or otherwise which undermines damages an individual s control over their own thinking behaviour emotions or decision making theories of brainwashing and of mind control were originally developed to explain how totalitarian regimes appeared to succeed systematically in indoctrinating prisoners of war through propaganda and torture techniques some authors have pointed out that the ideas of mind control can be found in all stages of human history they are essentially the extreme use of techniques of religious conversion and propaganda which are widespread in human history the oxford english dictionary records the earliest known use of brainwashing in an article edward hunter in miami news published on october during the korean war hunter who worked at the time both as a journalist before becoming a u s intelligence agent wrote a series of books and articles on the theme of chinese brainwashing the chinese term x n o literally wash brain was originally used to describe methodologies of coercive persuasion used under the maoist regime in china the methods aimed to change people s mindset so they became right thinking members of the new chinese social system hunter and those who picked up the chinese term used it to explain why unlike in earlier wars a relatively high percentage of american gis defected to the enemy side after becoming prisoners of war british radio operator robert w ford and british army colonel james carne also claimed that the chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their war era imprisonment the most prominent case in the u s was that of frank schwable a prisoner in the war while in custody he confessed to having taken part in germ warfare after the korean war mind control theories shifted in focus from politics to religion from the s an increasing number of youths started to come into contact with new religious movements nrm some who converted suddenly adopted beliefs and behaviors that differed greatly from those of their families and friends in some cases they neglected or broke contact with their loved ones those against cults explained these sudden and seemingly dramatic religious conversions as due to mind control the media was quick to follow suit and social scientists sympathetic to the anti cult movement who were usually psychologists developed more sophisticated models of brainwashing while some psychologists were receptive to these theories sociologists were for the most part skeptical of their ability to explain conversion to nrms", " a mindset is a state that usually a majority of people would have in a particular time or occasion it is formed from things that people are convinced about it is like a collected norm mindset can also be about how people see their abilities in this sense people have two types of mindsets fixed and growth mindsets psychologist carol dweck explains that students with fixed mindset believe their basic abilities their intelligence their talents are just fixed characteristics they have a certain amount and they improve and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb in a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort good teaching and working hard they don t necessarily think everyone s the same or anyone can be einstein but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it", " moral reasoning is a topic studied in psychology and in moral philosophy it studies how people think about moral issues problems and questions psychologists who have studied it include lawrence kohlberg and elliot turiel kohlberg said that moral understanding develops in three main stages as a person gets older but turiel said that there are three domains of moral understanding that develop at the same time as a person gets older moral philosophy or ethics is a major branch of philosophy it is the study of value or quality it covers the analysis and use of concepts such as right wrong good evil and

community choice people can learn morals from religion parents friends school books or from ethical traditions people that teach or follow morals are called moralists it can also be a lesson that someone learns in a book or story it is usually one line at the end of the story the moral of this story is fables are stories with a moral the opposite of moral is immoral meaning the wrong thing to do amoral means something that is not related to morality or has no morally good or bad aspect to it it is the same as morally neutral morality means that you can tell between a right and a wrong thing", " motivation is an important part of human psychology it arouses a person to act towards a desired goal it is a driving force which promotes action for example hunger is a motivation which causes a desire to eat motivation is an energizer of behavior motivation is the purpose or psychological cause of an action with animals motivation is caused by basic needs needs for food water warmth safety mating protecting the young defending territory needs to escape pain and threats the drive to do these things is instinctive inborn and triggered by circumstance with humans whose mental life is so much more complex motivation is more complicated obviously humans feel the need for food and water avoid pain and so on but they are also capable of having long term plans which are more difficult to understand a drive or desire is a deficiency or need that activates behaviour aimed at a goal or an incentive drives may arise inside or outside an organism external drives for humans are rewards and punishments and can be quite subtle a frown or a smile may be sufficient for a young person drives often occur within the individual and may not need external stimuli to encourage the behaviour an example is the sexual drive which is driven by our hormone system the desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire the process is started by the brain s hypothalamus which releases pulses of gnrh gonadotropin releasing hormone this starts a whole chain of reactions which we call puberty longer term the hormone supporting male sex drive is testosterone and for women testosterone and oestrogen by contrast outside rewards and stimuli are used in training animals by giving them treats when they perform a trick correctly the treat motivates the animals to perform the trick consistently even later when the treat is removed from the process children are motivated to learn by approval of friendly adults and by their own pleasure at success motivation and emotion are intertwined emotional states tend to have motivational properties not all motivated behaviour is the result of conscious decisions freudian psychology suggests that much behaviour is motivated by unconscious factors working through a network of defence mechanisms symbolic disguises and psychological cloaks", " the myers briggs type indicator mbti is a set of questions based on psychology by answering the questions people can learn about how they tend to make choices they can also learn about how they view the world after answering the questions in the myers briggs type indicator people are placed in one of sixteen groups these groups are based on theories by carl gustav jung in his book psychological types katharine cook briggs and her daughter isabel briggs myers created the first set of questions during world war ii the set of questions was made to help women who were working for the first time katharine cook briggs and isabel briggs meyers thought that the set of questions would help women be happier and work better the set of questions has grown into the myers briggs type indicator the mbti that we use today was created in though there are sixteen types it is stated that there is no best type the types are considered all equal the mbti measures four things the first is extraversion e and introversion i extraverts are people who get energy from the outside world extraverts like to spend their time with other people introverts are people who get energy from the inside world introverts tend to get energy from thinking and reflecting the second measure is sensing s and intuition n sensing and intuition are ways of gathering information people who are sensing trust facts sensing people accept things if they can see hear touch taste or smell them people who tend to like intuition are more likely to accept outcomes based on other people and meanings that cannot be tested the third measure is thinking t and feeling f thinking and feeling are ways that people make decisions those who prefer thinking tend to make decisions alone they heavily weigh reason good sense order and cause and effect those who prefer feeling are more likely to think of the effect that a decision may have on other people they tend to try to gain balance and agreement with everyone that is involved those who prefer thinking do not think better than those who prefer feeling and those who prefer feeling do not make decisions based only on people the last measure is of judging j and perceiving p judging and perceiving detail how people deal with the outside world a person who likes judging tends to report that they use thinking or feeling to deal with the outside world a person who likes perceiving tends to report that they use sensing or intuition to deal with the outside world a myers briggs type is made up of each of the preferences above for example an estj would be a person who prefers extraversion sensing thinking and judging an infp would be a person who prefers introversion intuition feeling and perceiving", " narcissism is

someone wants to have but is able to live when they do not have it is called a want every person has the same basic needs for the body humans have bodily needs of water food clothing and shelter to live the need for water is the most important because a person will die very quickly when they do not have drinking water in a warm place food is the next most important need in a cold place the need for clothes or shelter may be next most important because a person will soon die when they do not have these other human needs are not so certain they are mostly needs for the mind it is often said that a person needs love family and friends these needs are for personal relationships they may also be wants it is true that a life may be better with these things but some friends can be bad or bad sometimes good relationships can make life very happy thinking about a need that is not possible can make a person very unhappy some of the study of philosophy is about questions like what are the needs of a human some scientists study the needs of human or animal minds and bodies the study of the mind is called psychology words about the mind the study of bodily needs is part of medicine", " a

of learning in it an individual changes its behaviour because of the consequences results of the behaviour the person or animal learns its behaviour has a consequence that consequence may be there are four different contexts in operant conditioning here the terms positive and negative are not used in their basic sense positive means that something is added and negative means something is taken away the idea of operant conditioning was first discovered by edward thorndike and analyzed by b f skinner operant conditioning is different from pavlov s classical conditioning operant conditioning deals with the voluntary modification of behaviour classical conditioning with training a reflex operant conditioning sometimes called instrumental learning was first studied by edward l thorndike he observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home made puzzle boxes when first put in the boxes cats took a long time to escape with experience successful responses occurred more frequently enabling the cats to escape in less time in his law of effect thorndike theorized that behaviours followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated in short some consequences strengthened behavior and some consequences weakened behavior thorndike produced the first known learning curves by this procedure b f skinner worked out a more detailed analysis of operant conditioning skinner invented the operant conditioning chamber which let him measure rate of response as a key dependent variable he used a record of lever presses or key pecks principles of operant conditioning", " an optical illusion also called a visual illusion is one which shows images that differ from normal reality the information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a perception that is normal but in these cases the appearance does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source there are three main types of visual illusion the general explanation for most illusions is the way the brain works on sense data to produce a meaningful perception a great th century psychologist hermann von helmholtz described perception as unconscious inferences from sensory data and past experience richard gregory discussed how the brain makes an hypothesis about what s out there and sometimes the hypothesis does not quite work out his model of perception is an interaction between data from sense organs and previous knowledge and experience researcher mark changizi of rensselaer polytechnic institute in new york thinks optical illusions are due to a neural lag when light hits the retina about one tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world scientists have known of the lag and have discussed how humans compensate for it some suggest that our motor system somehow modifies our movements to offset the delay changizi asserts that the human visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays by generating images of what will occur one tenth of a second into the future this foresight enables humans to react to events in the present enabling humans to perform reflexive acts like catching a fly ball and to maneuver smoothly through a crowd illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future and those perceptions do not match reality essentially the ideas of helmholz gregory and changizi are similar we do not mechanically turn sense data into a picture of the world as some had thought what we do is use our brains to work out what it is we are looking at this involves the use of memory and logic though at a fast rate the process is very good but not foolproof when it fails we get an illusion", " otherkin are

padded cells are made in special ways so that those having the crisis cannot hurt themselves padded cells have been used for a long time in psychiatry in the s their use declined in europe this is

of comparing things in pairs to judge which of two things is preferred or has a greater amount of some something or whether or not the two things are identical the method of pairwise comparison is used in the scientific study of preferences attitudes voting systems social choice public choice requirements engineering and multiagent ai systems in psychology literature it is often referred to as paired comparison if someone shows what they like more between two options this preference can be expressed as a pairwise comparison if the two alternatives are x and y these three pairwise comparisons are possible the person prefers x over y x y or xpy the person prefers y over x y x or ypx the person has no preference between both alternatives x y or xiy it is generally assumed that pairwise comparisons are transitive most agree on what transitivity is though there is debate about the transitivity of indifference the rules of transitivity are as follows this is linked to xpy or xiy being a total preorder p being the related strict weak order and i being the related equivalence relation some believe that indifference lack of preference is not transitive consider the following example suppose you like apples and you prefer apples that are larger now suppose there exists an apple a an apple b and an apple c that are the same except for the following suppose b is larger than a but it is not possible to see this without an extremely sensitive measuring device also suppose c is larger than b but this also can t be seen without a sensitive measuring device however the difference in sizes between apples a and c is large enough that you can see it in psychophysical terms the size difference between a and c is above the just noticeable difference jnd while the size differences between a and b and b and c are below the jnd you are confronted with the three apples in pairs without a sensitive measuring device because of this when shown only a and b you have no preference between apple a and apple b and you are indifferent between apple b and apple c when shown only b and c however when the pair a and c are shown you prefer c over a if pairwise comparisons are transitive by the four rules shown above then pairwise comparisons for a list of alternatives a a a an and an can take the form  for example if there are three alternatives a b and c then the possible preference orders are if the number of alternatives is n and indifference is not allowed then the number of possible preference orders for any given n value is n if indifference is allowed then the number of possible preference orders is the number of total preorders it can be expressed as a function of n  where s n k is the stirling number of the second kind", " parasomias are sleep

sensitive and sentimental when parents and society do not consider and address their needs aspirations and desires they feel dominated and leave home to pass most of their time with their friends on peer groups sometimes they cannot get proper counselling and guidelines in these stages consequently sometimes they can fall prey to many bad habits there are many positives and negatives by peer

taking in picking organizing and understanding sensory information it includes collecting data from sense organs and interpreting it in the brain consider this light enters our eyes and the brain works on this information to build up a mental picture of what is going on out there perception is a lot more than just information coming in it is an active process there are many ways to study perception there are biological or physiological approaches psychological approaches through the philosophy of mind and experiments there are studies by philosophers such as david hume john locke george berkeley the study of perception started with the study of sight this makes sense because humans understand the world largely by looking at it the first studies of perception happened in the years bc by the greek philosopher democritus he believed the shapes we see were pictures which flew to our eyes where our soul would then recognize them the philosopher plato bc later came up with a new idea he believed the eyes worked by first making light and then scanning the world another greek philosopher and student of plato called aristotle to bc did not agree with these ideas he presented a new theory aristotle s ideas were accepted for hundreds of years to follow ibn al haytham wrote the first mathematical description of the visual process kepler explained what is inside of the eye descartes said that the way our physical senses see the world does not affect how we think about the world locke and descartes both thought humans saw color because of the senses kant suggested that humans can t know about things which our senses don t see because of this he stated that a god and a soul were not possible new techniques were created and used to study the brain and perception many of these studies were paired with data on human behavior the psychologist wundt stated that perception could not just be explained by the way the body works and that psychology was needed too gestalt psychology was formed the idea behind this group of thinkers was that perception is more than the sum of our senses vision is what you see seeing something happens when light enters the eyes this light is turned into an electric message which travels to the brain and gets turned into a picture sound is what you hear the ears catch movement from sound waves which move in every direction the brain takes these in creating what we hear touch is what you feel with your skin the skin s top layer has receptors that take information in when touched these receptors can sense pain how hot or cold something is and how heavy something is receptors then send this information to our nervous system taste is the flavor of things we eat or drink our tongue has many little bumps which take in our food s flavor these bumps then send a message to our brain for us to taste the skin inside your nose has small cells which send messages to your brain when you breathe in your brain then senses the smell theories of perception can be sorted into two groups the first group believes in bottom up processing this approach means that to perceive humans only needs information from their senses for example light enters the eye this light is sent to the brain and the brain turns it into something we see the second group is top down processing in this approach perception starts off with something general and becomes specific what we already know or expect has a big effect here for example if you see half of a cat you will have an idea of what it looks like even though half of it is hidden this is because you have seen a cat before top down processing helps humans quickly make sense of their environment without having to think too much james gibson states that perception happens because of our human instincts this means it can t be learned he suggests that perception is needed for humans to stay alive neanderthals would have needed perception to escape danger suggesting perception is the result of evolution gibson s theory is known as the ecological theory because he says that perception can only be explained by our environment to gibson sensation perception palmer states that people have ideas about how the world looks like and they use that knowledge to figure out what things are he did a study in to show this in his study people were shown groups of pictures one picture was a location a kitchen for example the other three pictures were one object you would find in a kitchen bread and two pictures that had no ties to the kitchen an instrument and a mailbox this was repeated with many different places and objects his findings showed that people found it harder to recognize the objects that had no relationship to the location", " perfectionism in psychology is a type of personality where there is a need for oneself or others to be the best in any given part of life there are only two outcomes anything less than perfect is taken to be unacceptable the belief holds that one can achieve perfection and should aim for it a person who believes this is called a perfectionist at first some consider perfectionism as helpful perfectionism can lead people to achieve great things and give them motivation however it is considered to be a belief that is mostly unhealthy and harmful perfectionism makes people set goals that are unrealistic and cannot be reached this leads to many problems like depression anxiety eating disorders and low self esteem perfectionism may also lead to procrastination as it allows one to avoid being less than perfect i can t do this project until i can do it the right way this can mean low productivity perfectionistic behaviour is growing in the newer generation perfectionism has received more attention by popular sayings like practice makes perfect there are also more and more people who see themselves as a perfectionist these people also mentioned their difficulties which comes with this behaviour in d e hamachek shows that there are two types of perfectionists normal and neurotic normal perfectionists are people who set high goals for themselves the main thing is that they are open to making some errors neurotic perfectionists also set high goals but with no room for error they view themselves strictly at all times this makes them feel like nothing is done well enough both types set high standards for themselves this shows that the psychological problems that come with perfectionism come from viewing oneself strictly there are a few models of perfectionism in hewitt et al released one of the most detailed models their comprehensive model of perfectionistic behaviour splits perfectionism into many levels of a personality style there are three levels trait level self presentational or other relational level cognitive or self relational level  the first part of this model is multiple perfectionistic traits that are linked they include self oriented perfectionism socially prescribed perfectionism and other oriented perfectionism these are measures of the multidimensional perfectionism scale mps the second level is concerned with the image oneself presents to others the relational part says that rather than needing to be perfect there is a need to only appear so this leads to displays of perfection and hiding imperfections they avoid making mistakes in front of others or speaking about their imperfections this is due to a fear of being judged badly by others which will cause feelings of low self esteem the cognitive part of this model refers to repeated and automatic cognitive thoughts of needing to be perfect there is a rumination of the difference between one s present actual self and the perfect self that one can should be early theorists suggest perfectionism as firm unrealistic goals for oneself these clinical observations were important however it was not possible to sum up perfectionism as a single term this led frost et al in and in hewitt and flett to come up with their own multidimensional scales of perfectionism frost s multidimensional perfectionism scale fmps measures different dimensions of perfectionism concern over mistakes cm very high personal standards ps views of parental expectations pe views of parental criticism pc doubts about one s actions d and organisation o  examples of cm if i fail at work school i fail as a person if i do not do as well as others i am a worse human and the less mistakes i make the more people will like me examples of ps if i do not set the highest standards for myself i will end up second and i expect a higher performance of myself than normal people examples of pe my parents wants me to be the best at everything examples of pc i was punished if i did something less than perfect and i felt like i cannot meet my parent s standards examples of d feeling like a task is not done right even though it was done very carefully examples of o liking to be neat and organised hewitt flett s mps is a item scale measuring three parts of perfectionism self oriented perfectionism other oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism the difference between these parts is not behavioural displays it is to whom perfectionism is directed to self or others or to whom the perfectionistic behaviour is placed by socially prescribed  self oriented perfectionism refers to the setting of impossible standards and strictly examining oneself although there are harmful effects it also results in motivation by aiming to achieve perfection while avoiding failure other oriented perfectionism is placing unrealistic standards for significant others there is a focus on others being perfect and strictly examining them this leads to blaming lack of trust and unkind feelings towards others however this dimension may link to leadership ability and giving motivation to others socially prescribed perfectionism is the believed need to achieve unrealistic standards placed by other people on oneself as the standards placed by others are felt as too much it may often lead to anger anxiety and depression", " persuasion is a form of influence it is the way to get people to agree with an idea

disability is also called mental retardation intellectual developmental disability or general learning disability it is an illness of the brain intellectual disability often starts when someone is very young to have an intellectual disability a person must there are two major types of intellectual disability the first is syndromic intellectual disability this means that the person has a syndrome that causes intellectual disability as well as medical issues and other problems down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome are two examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities the second is non syndromic intellectual disability this means that the intellectual disability is not a part of a syndrome there are three levels of intellectual disability based on how severe a person s disability is mild intellectual disability may not be noticed until a child starts school moderate and severe intellectual disability can be seen before a child starts school people with syndromic intellectual disabilities may have a typical look for example the picture on the right shows facial features that many people with fetal alcohol syndrome have people with non syndromic intellectual disability do not look any different than a person without a disability the symptoms of intellectual disability are all behavioral people with intellectual disability may have some or all of these most children with intellectual disabilities can learn however they usually will not learn things as fast as other children they may need to be taught things in a certain way in order to learn them and remember them intellectual disability is different from dementia in dementia people forget things and they lose skills they once had people with an intellectual disability never learn those skills often no one knows what caused a child s intellectual disability this happens in between one third and one half of all cases of intellectual disability the top three most common causes of intellectual disability are down syndrome digeorge syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome genetic disorders are caused by problems with a child s genes children are born with these disorders substances called teratogens can prevent a fetus from developing normally if a teratogen enters a woman s body while she is pregnant it can cause developmental problems like intellectual disabilities examples of teratogens that can cause intellectual disabilities include for example if a child does not get enough oxygen during birth it can hurt the brain and lead to intellectual disability later some childhood illnesses like measles and whooping cough can cause intellectual disability if not treated properly so can infections that affect the brain like meningitis and viral encephalitis brain injuries can cause intellectual disability at any age lack of proper nutrition can lead to intellectual disability over time iodine deficiency not having enough iodine in the body can lead to several medical issues including intellectual disability the most common way to prevent this is by adding iodine to salt this is a much more common problem in developing countries in the dsm there are three requirements a person has to meet in order to be diagnosed with an intellectual disability first the person must have a low intelligence quotient iq iq is measured with an iq test if the person has an iq of below they may have an intellectual disability however they must still meet the other two requirements to be diagnosed with an intellectual disability second to qualify for an intellectual disability a person must have trouble in more than one area of normal daily activities these activities are often called adaptive behaviors or activities of daily living adls some examples of adaptive behavior are to see if a child is having trouble with these a doctor will talk to people who know the child and will watch the child s behavior the final requirement is that the symptoms of intellectual disability have to begin in childhood or adolescence if the issues do not start at a young age they are probably caused by a different illness of the brain there is currently no cure for intellectual disability those affected can learn to cope and do many things if they get enough support and are taught well there are many places around the world for someone with intellectual disability to get help these places can take care of people with intellectual disabilities as well as help them find jobs find a house of their own or help them take care of their children there are some different ways for people with intellectual disability and those around them to learn how to help the person with the disability one kind is psychosocial treatment this is meant for very young children psychosocial treatment helps them learn basic skills and increase learning over their lifetime another kind is behavioral treatment this is meant to help young people but can be used for adults as well behavior treatment helps teach language skills as well as social skills like sharing or following instructions a third kind of help is cognitive behavioral treatment this is a combination of the previous two treatments cognitive behavioral therapy helps children with intellectual disability both learn skills and learn how to plan ahead another type of help a person with intellectual disability can get is family oriented help family oriented help focuses on teaching family members how to help the person in their family with intellectual disability many people with an intellectual disability have other health problems for which they will be given specific drugs as an example autistic children with developmental delay may use anti psychotics or mood stabilizers to help with behavior giving drugs to intellectually disabled people needs to be monitored side effects often occur and are wrongly diagnosed as problems with behavior or as psychiatric problems people have had intellectual disability throughout history people with intellectual disability have had a lot of trouble in the past the oldest idea of where intellectual disability came from was in ancient greece hippocrates thought that intellectual disability was caused by an issue with the four humors for several hundred years in europe churches took care of people with intellectual disabilities in the th century thomas willis suggested that intellectual disability was a disease caused by issues with the structure of the brain in the th and th centuries people with intellectual disabilities were put in asylums the asylums would give them basics like food and shelter but were not always good to the people in them in the early th century people with intellectual disability were made to not be able to have children and could not marry it was thought that this would reduce the amount of intellectual disabilities in the future this is not done anymore because it does not follow the idea of human rights in the s a group called the civitans started to help people with intellectual disability in the s many people wanted to remove the stigma around people with intellectual disability now

in robert ader and nicholas cohen advanced pni with a demonstration of classic conditioning of the immune function and coined the term psychoneuroimmunology ader was investigating how long conditioned responses might last in laboratory rats the highly reproducible results showed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were immuno suppressed in other words a signal via the nervous system taste was affecting immune function this was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system in david felten then working at the indiana university of medicine discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system the researchers also found nerves in the thymus and spleen terminating near clusters of lymphocytes macrophages and mast cells all of which help control immune function this discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro immune interaction occurs ader cohen and felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book psychoneuroimmunology in which laid out the underlying premise that the brain and immune system represent a single integrated system of defense stressors can produce profound health consequences in one epidemiological study for example all cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor the death of a spouse theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which in turn induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes these ultimately impair immune function potential health consequences

in some places in some religions and cultures it was bad luck to mention a dead child s name even among european royal families a dead child was often referred to by his or her title and not their name among the replacement children of holocaust survivors the names of the dead were often not spoken of the name was memorialized in the replacement child because they were alive the name could be used in early modern europe the name given a child was supposed to make them like the person they were named for in many cases the name given a child was an attempt to recreate the lost child or ancestor the grief the family felt over the dead child was made better by naming the child after the lost child this shows a belief that dead spirits were present among the living in renaissance italy

was and is the same the difference between early heirs and spares and the modern practice is that today a female can inherit the throne", " resilience generally means the ability to recover from some shock or disturbance there are different meanings for resilience is a term used in psychology to describe the capacity of people to cope with stress and catastrophe it is also used to indicate a characteristic of resistance to future negative events this psychological meaning of resilience is often contrasted with risk factors in physics and engineering resilience is defined as the capacity of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically and then upon unloading to have this energy recovered in other words it is the maximum energy per volume that can be elastically stored it is represented by the area under the curve in the elastic region in the stress strain diagram modulus of resilience u r displaystyle u r can be calculated using the following formula u r e e displaystyle u r frac sigma e sigma epsilon sigma left frac sigma e right where displaystyle sigma is yield stress e is young s modulus and displaystyle epsilon is strain an example of a biomaterial which has a high resilience is articular cartilage the substance lining the ends of bones in articulating joints such as the knee and hip in ecology resilience has been defined in two competing fashions that emphasize two different aspects of stability one definition is the rate at which a system returns to a single steady or cyclic state following a perturbation this definition of resilience assumes that behavior of a system remains within the stable domain that contains this steady state when a system can reorganize that is shift from one stability domain to another a more relevant measure of ecosystem dynamics is ecological resilience it is a measure of the amount of change or disruption that is required to transform a system from being maintained by one set of mutually reinforcing processes and structures to a different set of processes and structures the second definition emphasizes conditions far from any steady states where instabilities can flip a system into another regime of behavior i e to another stability domain in this case resilience is measured by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system changes its structure by changing the variables and processes that control behavior this type of resilience has been defined as ecological resilience economic resilence is the ability of a local economy to retain function employment and prosperity in the face of the perturbation caused by the shock of the loss of a particular type of local industry or employer within the broad domain of industrial safety the term resilience has come into use to emphasise that safety must be proactive as well as reactive whereas conventional risk management approaches emphasise calculation of failure probabilities resilience engineering looks for ways to strengthen the ability of organisations to create processes that are robust yet flexible resilience is the ability of the network to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of various faults and challenges to normal operation resilient networks aim to provide acceptable service to applications", " the sage also called wise old man or senex is

suicidal behavior many self harmers hurt themselves because they feel it is the only way to stay alive however in some cases the self harm becomes so bad it can lead to death and those who self harm are more likely to commit suicide than those who do not there are many different reasons why a person may hurt themselves though it is often hard to find an exact cause sometimes the self harm helps relieve unbearable emotions or feelings of unreality or numbness self harm is often a symptom of other problems these problems may include physical abuse sexual abuse or eating disorders self harm may also stem from mental problems such as low self esteem or perfectionism studying the causes of self injury can be difficult or inaccurate because many self harmers try to hide their injuries self injury is a general term that includes many different types of deliberate harm to the body there are many things that can be considered self harm if someone works their body too hard for example this can be seen as a mild form of self injury in other mild cases a self harmer may purposely pick off scabs to keep cuts or scratches from healing compulsive hair pulling trichotillomania and compulsive skin picking dermotillomania are impulse control disorders which are also mild forms of self harm in more severe cases a self harmer could break or sprain a bone or lose a dangerous amount of blood biting burning and cutting are other forms of self injury overdosing on medication is another common type of self harm self harm may get worse the longer a person has been doing it this is because a person s body builds up tolerance to gets used to the pain from their injuries because of this they have to hurt themselves more to get the same effect in some cases this can lead to fatal or near fatal injuries a person may go through voluntary pain for other reasons that are usually not considered self injury a self inflicted wound is when someone injures themselves to avoid something not because of psychological problems some people give themselves a self inflicted wound during wartime so that they do not have to serve in the military some people go through pain to change the way they

those with mental illness one in four of teenagers with mental illnesses have self harmed self harm in females is most common between the ages of males are most likely to self harm through the ages recent research focusing on young people suggests that percent of to year olds have self harmed in this case the self harm was usually done by cutting a study in oxford in the year found that approximately per of males aged between and years and per of females of the same age were admitted into a hospital after self harming based on statistics like these most agree that young white females are most likely to self injure possibly because of this it is usually believed that women have higher rates of self harm than men however this may not be true because women are more likely to get help for their self injury males may have the same or similar rates of self injury as women some findings have even suggested that in the mid s age range more men are treated for self harm than women minority groups who face discrimination are also more likely to self injure if someone is bullied because they are different for example because of their race ethnicity or sexual orientation this can lead to low self esteem and a feeling of helplessness over emotions this can lead some people to self harm studies have show that those who have been abused are more likely to self injure sexual abuse

esteem in victims of abuse may lead them to believe that the abuse was their fault they may turn to self injury because of this unstable living conditions such as unemployment or divorce may also make a person more likely to self harm prisoners are also more likely to self harm this may be because of the ongoing trauma that happens in prisons including sexual and physical violence and intimidation in an environment such as prison where options for inmates are limited prisoners may turn to self injury in england and wales a report from the howard league says that over prisoners harmed themselves in those with learning and developmental disabilities such as autism are more likely to self harm the cause of this is unclear some case studies have shown that it may be a form of self stimulation it

may help a person understand why they self harm cognitive behavioural therapy is used to help patients understand the reasons for their problem this is so that the patient may learn what is causing their self harm and learn how to deal with these problems in a way other than self harm therapies used for post traumatic stress disorder may also help this is because many people who self harm have been victims of abuse eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy emdr is an example of this drugs may also be used to help treat self injury it is thought that self injury can release chemical endorphins into the brain over time these chemicals can become addictive there are some drugs that can help with this addiction but they have not been proven to help people who self injure naltrexone and naloxone are two drugs being researched for this kind of treatment research involving endorphins has been mostly done with animals it is unclear if their brain chemistry changes the

knowledge of the world some simple animals can only tell light from dark but with vertebrates the visual system is able to form images the ability to interpret visible light information reaching the eyes is called visual perception sight is the resulting perception the components that are necessary for vision are known as the visual system light enters the animal s eyes and a part of the eye called the lens sends information from the light to the back part of the eye called the retina the retina is composed of light sensitive cells which fire a signal down the optic nerve when light hits the cell the optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres from all over the retina when the information from the light leaves the retina it goes to the brain it travels along the optic chiasma until it reaches the optic cortex at the rear of the brain the information is then processed to find out the shapes and colours of objects from that and from memory it can tell of what kind the object is for example it can somehow tell a tree from a house the path on which this kind of information flows is called ventral stream the brain can also tell where objects are for example it can tell how far away an object is this is called depth perception this is needed when catching a ball the path on which this kind of information flows is called dorsal stream the major problem in visual perception is that what people see is not simply a translation of an image on the retina for one thing we see the world right side up even though the image on the retina is upside down because it has passed through the lens therefore it is difficult to explain what happens to create what we actually see the key which took centuries to be appreciated is that the brain works on the data from the eyes and marries it with memories and guesses all at lightning speed the result is an experience of the world which looks to each person as if it were simple reality however although based on reality it is actually a mental construct built by the brain many figures in the ancient world had ideas about vision plato aristotle euclid ptolemy and galen all had their ideas but most of these ideas were speculation they were not based on any scientific method alhazen c carried out investigations and experiments on visual perception he extended the work of ptolemy on binocular vision and commented on the anatomical works of galen leonardo da vinci is believed to be the first to recognize the special optical qualities of the eye he wrote the function of the human eye was described by a large number of authors in a certain way but i found it to be completely different his main experimental finding was that there is only a distinct and clear vision at the line of sight the optical line that ends at the fovea although he did not use these words literally he actually is the father of the modern distinction between foveal and peripheral vision hermann von helmholtz examined the human eye and concluded that it was optically rather poor the poor quality information gathered by the eye seemed to him to make vision impossible so he thought vision could only be the result of some form of unconscious inferences as well as information from the eyes the brain used information from previous experiences the world as experienced is built up from assumptions and conclusions from incomplete data using prior experience of the world examples of well known assumptions based on visual experience are the study of visual illusions cases when the inference process goes wrong has yielded much insight into what sort of assumptions the visual system makes", " silliness is when a person acts like a fool or shows a lack of good sense or judgment in television movies and the circus silliness such as

to the bathroom and cleaning sometimes they are dangerous examples include cooking driving extremely violent gesture or grabbing at hallucinated objects or even homicide generally sleepwalking cases consist of simple repeated behaviours occasionally there are reports of people performing complex behaviours while asleep but the legitimacy of these claims is often disputed in sleep medicine experts

sleepwalking including one inviting a friend around for dinner and drinks sleepwalkers often have little or no memory of the what they do because they are not truly conscious their eyes are open but their expression is dim and glazed over sleepwalking may last as little as seconds or as long as thirty minutes there is no data about how common sleepwalking is estimates say that one to two percent of adults are sleepwalkers sleepwalking seems to be more common in children between ten and thirty percent of children are affected in most cases they stop sleepwalking during puberty most cases of

data in that case social engineering is also called social hacking an early way of social engineering first occurred in the s and was named phreaking phreakers called phone companies and claimed to be system administrators and asked for passwords which they used to connect illegally and free of charge to the internet a more modern form of social engineering is called phishing phishing is derived from fishing which is an attempt to get access to internet user s data via faked www addresses the most common way of phishing is fraud mailing also known as scam mailing where the victim is being sent a fake e mail i e of a bank in most scam mails the letter includes a link that is redirecting to a fake website which is logging the login id and the appropriate password of the victim the hackers are often using dns spoofing to fake the sender s e mail address the main model of social engineering shows up with faked phone calls the social engineer calls employees of a company and impersonates a technician who needs sensitive data to complete important technical operations in advance the attacker has gathered information about work routines of the target company from public sources or former raid attempts that gives him advantage in further social engineering trials the invader tries to confuse his victims and to seem trustful using trade language and involving the victims in small talk further the assaulter pretends authority to frighten his victims under circumstances the employee actually requested technical support and is expecting such a phone call the prevention of social engineering is difficult by influencing the victim subconsciously the invader abuses typical human behavior like helpfulness in emergency situations or to respond with help to the seemingly helpful attacker general mistrust would disturb the efficient and trustful team work of an organization the most effective way to avoid social engineering is to assure the identity of the caller this can already be done by asking for the caller s name and phone number and to politely ask for patience even if the caller s issue seems to be very urgent even if one could verify the caller s identity one should only hand out the absolutely necessary information social engineering became generally known through kevin david condor mitnick movies takedown also known as hackers who became

healthcare management works toward systems transformation through coalitions with various departments and in hospital operations at every stage in life health is determined by complex interactions between social and economic factors the physical environment and behavior they do not exist in isolation from each other the wider the income gap within a society the higher its mortality and morbidity rates it is studied that half of all healthcare outcomes are linked to the social determinants hence an actions taken by a social worker to reduce health inequalities will also have economic benefits following are the functions of a medical social worker medical social workers help the patient s and their families to manage life crises due to acute or chronic medical conditions and focus on improving their mental and physical well being which is done by counseling needs assessment and psychosocial assessments which involves a thinking process that seeks out the meaning of case

the medical social worker s role medical social workers lead support group discussions provide individual counseling help patients determine appropriate health care and other health services and provide support to patients with serious or chronic illnesses medical social workers also work in health and safety aspects of a hospital setting there contributions lead to reduced hospital acquired infection hai the social worker attempts to makes changes in poor workplace conditions e g overworked staff time pressures lack of safety protocols or lack of appropriate supervision as well as poor individual conditions e g fatigue stress or illness to reduce medical errors a study conducted by dawson reid in found that health care professionals that are being awake hours was equivalent to

social worker is assisting patients along with staff members to cope with psychosocial problems associated with ill health and thus promote the overall wellness of theirs in the hospital setting medical social workers play an important role in coordinating patient discharge planning and after care services following the physician s notification that the patient is ready for discharge there are a number of factors that influence the timing of discharge in private community hospitals it can be costly to allow patients to remain inpatient when it is no longer medically necessary discharge delays can prove costly to the hospital and to the patient depending on the patient s funding source social workers also assist patients and families access in home health care services arrange for in home medical equipment provide for transportation coordinate follow up treatments and refer patients to a wide variety of community social service agencies medical social workers are often also responsible for helping patients access financial assistance and health insurance coverage in some settings medical social workers work closely with public and private health insurers to determine the

directly involved in the patient s care it is also the responsibility of the medical social worker to manage any dispute in the multidisciplinary team medical social workers also need to have good analytical and excellent assessment skills an ability to communicate the medical language physiology of the disease and the types of treatment offered with both patients and the family is necessary

especially in situations where the medical social worker has identified problems that may compromise the well being of patient or in any distress in the discharge process that might put the patient at risk an understanding between advocacy and collaboration loyalty to the patient and the institution is important for a hospital social worker for example a medical provider may report that a frail elderly patient who lives alone is medically stable for discharge and plans to discharge the patient home with in home services after assessing the patient s psychosocial needs the medical social worker determines that the patient does not have the ability to manage at home safely even with the intervention of a home care worker the medical social worker informs the medical provider that the proposed discharge plan may place the patient at risk and the discharge plan is deferred pending further assessment the medical social worker can then collaborate with multidisciplinary providers to develop a more appropriate discharge plan even if that leads to discharge delays medical social workers value the ethical concept of patient autonomy and self determination although this value can conflict with the values and ethics of other disciplines in a medical setting medical social workers strive to preserve the patient s right to make his or her own decisions about goals of care treatment planning discharge etc as long as the patient is capable of making those decisions him herself patients often make decisions that medical professionals disagree with but the medical social worker advocates for the patient s right to self determination if the patient is not able to make his her own decisions based on a cognitive or other impairment the right of self determination can be superseded by concern that a patient is a risk to self or others as medical social workers often have large case loads and have to meet tight deadlines for arranging necessary services medical social work is a demanding job that is vulnerable to detrimental impact often this job requires tolerance due to its lackluster reality of unsupportive and hostile environment and cross departmental nature with nursing and public relations which diminishes the visibility authority gradient of the profession within an institution the inadequate salary and restrained professional growth is also a major concern for medical social workers medical social workers often deal with complex cases involving patients who come into the hospital with multiple psycho social issues all of which require assessment and treatment it is not uncommon for medical social workers to tackle cases involving homelessness chronic unemployment lack of income lack of health insurance coverage history of incarceration and substance abuse problems any of these problems separately and together can impede timely care services sometimes situations as seemingly ordinary as the patient needing bus fare or a decent pair of shoes can lead to delays in discharge which could incur social and healthcare costs especially if these needs are not identified quickly and early a poor or non existent relationship between assessment and interventions due to lack of structured communication sbar situation background assessment and recommendation policies economic restraints could also cause this this is why a complete and timely assessment of the patient s psychosocial needs are critical for empowering and recovery by a medical social worker with a repertoire of management assessment and treatment skills who is adept in functioning within the hospital s continuum atmosphere of change and shifting priorities is required ", " sociocultural theory was created by lev vygotsky as a response to behaviorism the main idea of the theory is that the ways people interact with others and the culture they live in shape their mental abilities vygotsky believed that parents relatives peers and society all have an important role in forming higher levels of functioning sociocultural theory as stated by cole john steiner scribner and souberman is the belief that every function in the child s cultural development appears twice first on the social level and later on the individual level this means that the skills children learn first are related to interactions with others and they then take that information and use it within themselves lev vygotsky was born in in russia he graduated from moscow university in and started his career as a psychologist during the russian revolution he taught literature and psychology for seven years vygotsky went against the leading scientists of his time by suggesting that scientific psychology should not ignore the role of consciousness most scientists at the time disagreed with his ideas however he was still offered a job at the institute of psychology in moscow there he worked on his new ideas of psychology on june vygotsky died from an illness although his work did get some attention during his lifetime it was not until the s when joseph stalin died and politics did not have a large role in academics that his views were widely known in russia vygotsky s ideas did not gain fame in the united states until around twenty years later the main desire of vygotsky was to design a new way to look at and come up with a solution to educational and social problems of the time he believed other factors besides biological instincts caused humans to act the way they do he was the first modern psychologist to suggest a way in which culture plays a part in each person s nature vygotsky believed the inclusion of sign systems from a child s culture changes behavior and connects early and later forms of individual development vygotsky was a strong supporter of the idea that what children learned from other people in their own culture helped them develop he considers human thought processes to be based on social interactions and language three key areas of sociocultural theory are the zone of proximal development private speech and make believe play vygotsky stated that humans master themselves from the outside through psychological tools pg psychological tools are language writing styles counting system and conventional signs miller psychological tools are also inclusive of learning strategies and modes of attending and memorization that is taught in an individual s school such tools are utilized to guide individual s thoughts and behaviors the culture of which a person is embedded dictates which tools social interactions and skills are needed what one culture values may differ from another thus the tools provided reflect specific cultural values and needs for example western society places importance on education and technology as these are needed to be self sufficient in that part of the world other societies such as more indigenous types may emphasis the importance of hunting gathering type behaviors as one can see psychological tools indigenous societies utilizes versus the ones in which western societies utilize would differ children use their psychological tools to cognitively transform their social experiences vygotsky felt learning in children should be related to their developmental level this caused him to argue that learning takes place within a zone of proximal development zpd which is made up of functions that are not yet fully formed but are on the way to being established the zpd draws attention to three important issues first it focuses attention on children s mental functions that are currently going on but are not yet complete second it recognized help from peers or adults as a method of learning third it helped to separate between actual and potential learning ability the actual ability of a child is what they can do without any help from others while potential learning ability is when a child needs help in order to complete a task three assumptions are often discussed in relation to the zpd they include generality assumption assistance assumption and potential assumption the zpd is mainly used for two types of cognitive development analysis one reason zpd is used is to pick out the functions needed for learning as a child ages the second test done by zpd is to figure out where the child is at the moment mentally in relation to where they are supposed to be or where they will be as they grow in the s bruner wood and ross created the term scaffolding to add to sociocultural theory scaffolding describes the interaction between a child and an adult who helps them finish a task that they could not do alone scaffolding relates to vygotsky s sociocultural theory because it recognizes the role of social interaction on learning and how other people affect the development of children it involves changing the way a more skilled person helps a child in doing a task based on their available learning ability just like physical scaffolding is used to support buildings as they are being made scaffolding in sociocultural theory helps support a child as their mental processes develop private speech takes place when children talk to themselves vygotsky saw this as the starting point for all mental developments according to lantolf vygotsky believed it is the process of privatizing speech that higher forms of consciousness arise on the inner plane and in this way our biological capacities are organized into a culturally mediated mind in simpler terms vygotsky thought that it was by using private speech that a child s biological instincts were made into culturally acceptable ways of acting he suggested that children spoke to themselves as a way of guiding themselves through an action vygotsky suggested that private speech changes as children age beginning as external out loud speech when they are younger but then becoming more internal within themselves as they age through relationships with more capable people children get information and use that understanding in their private speech vygotsky thought private speech showed how children use the support given to them by others to assist their own way of thinking and how they act vygotsky saw make believe play as an important part of child development it is one of the main ways of developing during the preschool years children use make believe play to test multiple skills and achieve important cultural abilities vygotsky suggested that as children take part in made up situations they learn how to act in agreement with their internal ideas not just external ideas during play children put themselves into the adult roles of their culture and practice how they will act in the future play takes place before development so children can start to gain the motivation abilities and attitudes needed for social participation which can be done only with the help of peers and adults make believe play allows children to practice how they would act in the real world it provides them with a way to gain the basic skills needed to function in their society before they become adults however learning these roles and skills is only done with help from others in their culture", " sport psychology means applying parts of psychology to sports and athletes one of the main ways that sports psychologists use is to help athletes meet their goals the main group of people that sports psychologists try to help are professional athletes they can help non professional athletes as well sports psychologists mainly focus on problems the athlete has on the field but they can also help athletes with problems that they have off the field sports psychology did not become a recognized area of study until recently but it has been used in the past sports psychology began at the end of the nineteenth century in europe sports and the body were now a more important part of people s lives during the s more sports were a part of the lifestyle of the people but the word psychology was not used in connection with the word sport before the late s in and the phrase psychology of sport appeared in the titles of two journal articles the first one was by balduin groller it was published in two parts in in the journal die wage under the title zur psychologie des sportes translated about the psychology of sport this article said that there were parts of psychology that had not been researched at that time that could be connected to sports and physical activities then in may an essay by the founder of the modern olympic movement pierre de coubertin was published it was titled le psychologie du sport translated the psychology of sport in pyotr francevich lesgaft started a system of physical education lesgaft was a russian scientist who studied the human body his aim was to promote harmony between the body and soul or mind the method lesgaft suggested was to learn conscious control of the body being able to think about controlling the body and then actually doing it then in karoly budinsky wrote an article called about gymnastic activity and the development of will the article was about how self control and willpower could make the nervous system stronger through physical exercise two scientists were at the beginning of european sport psychology angelo mosso and philippe tissie angelo mosso was an italian who studied the human body he was also interested in using science to study physical education exercise and sport in his experiments mosso found that mental work causes weakness of the muscles he also found that physical work causes weakness in mental performance in mosso conducted an experiment with his brother ugolino mosso he had ten italian mountain soldiers climb to the top of the mountain and live in a hut for ten days he also had them perform physical exercises there are two parts of his results that are related to sports psychology the first one is called the pioneer effect the pioneer effect is when in mountain climbing the person who is leading the group will be more tired than all the others the second is called the rivaling effect the rivaling effect is when the soldiers especially in periods of boredom would begin to compete with each other in their weight lifting tests philippe tissie viewed sports as a way to treat mental disorders he published several articles between and these articles talked about how sports could help people with mental disorders he thought that a combination of sports gymnastics and psychology could help people with mental disorders he also thought that playing in too many sports could cause people to have mental disorders and behavioral problems in a french doctor named charles du pasquier published an article about how sports could help people with depression in eduard bertz said that sports could help people maintain a healthy body and soul or mind later in toby cohn believed sports was a way for people to develop self confidence emotional health and goal orientation in bernhard berliner conducted the first study on what effect sports and exercise had on the mind and psychology in his study he looked at children who exercised and played sports while at a camp his study found that children who played sports and exercised were able to concentrate better the first sports psychology laboratory was opened in in berlin germany by carl diem that same year a psychological lab was opened by robert werner schulte at the deutsche hochschue fur leibesubungen near berlin this was a college for physical education the lab was used to study the natural ability that people had for doing good in sports schulte also included sports psychology in his talks to students who took physical education then in he published his first book this book was named body and mind in sport he then continued to go on to write many books about the topic of sport psychology one of these books was called aptitude and performance testing in sport the next development in was the first psychoanalysis of what motivated people to want to play sports this was done by helene deutsch she found that playing in sports could help people with depression anxiety and overcoming fears there were also major developments to the field of sports psychology that took place in russia in russian sports psychologist petr antonovic rudik did research on the development of skills and on reaction times a reaction time is how quickly someone responds to something in alexander netchayev did research on how perception memory imagination and attention are influenced by sports and physical activities sports psychology in north america began in the s e w scripture began to study the reaction times of runners in his yale lab he also watched how athletes could be helped by experimental psychology experimental psychology uses experiments and science to study the brain and the mind he also wrote papers about how sports affected who a person was in his papers he argued that prisoners who participated in sports while in jail got a better attitude george wells fitz was also active in sports psychology at this time fitz created the first known physical education lab in north america in fitz ran an experiment this experiment focused on studying the reaction times of people he found one thing in his results people who had quicker and more accurate reaction times would be better at sports fitz was the first to run experiments on reaction times in north america the next major event in sports psychology was an idea known as transfer of training transfer of training happens when you exercise one arm or one side of the body to make it stronger and the other side also becomes stronger without having any exercise this area was first studied by walter wells davis in the late s davis ran an experiment that involved having people lift weights with one arm and not the other his results proved the theory of transfer of training william g anderson also studied this concept in his experiments he found that people who squeezed an object on one side of the body also got stronger on the opposite side of the body the next developments came from norman tripplett norman tripplett worked at the university of indiana as a psychologist he conducted an experiment that focused on competition this experiment started to connect sports and psychology his experiment also began to combine them into one field in tripplett started his study he focused on how the performance of one person is influenced by other people being around in he wrote about his results in his article the dynamogenic factors involved in pace making and competition his beliefs and findings were that cyclists were more likely to cycle faster when in the presence of a pacemaker or a competitor people were more likely to cycle faster because the presence of another person caused them to put in more effort and use energy that they were not before in tripplett tried to confirm his predictions and beliefs he came up with during the cycling study by running an experiment in laboratory this experiment consisted of people winding fishing line as fast as they could in order to move a flag around a course the results of this experiment confirmed the results and predictions that were found in the cycling study in g t w patrick studied the psychology of american football and why people loved the game so much next in howard wanted to discover why people became so emotional while watching sports then in karl s lashley and john b watson started a study that focused on the learning curve of people in sports a learning curve is how people learn the skills they need to in order to succeed in sports the sport that they focused their study on was archery the results of their study lead them to argue that when people were participating in harder tasks like archery they were more likely to work harder to complete the task sportswriter hugh s fullerton is involved in the next development in the history of sports psychology fullerton brought new york yankees player babe ruth to a psychology laboratory at columbia university fullerton brought ruth there to participate in a study run by albert johanson and joseph holmes he wanted ruth to participate in the study because he wanted to find a reason for why ruth hit so many home runs he also wanted to prove to other baseball scouts whether or not other players like ruth existed the study that ruth participated in was used to study sensory motor performance sensory motor performance is how things that we perceive with our senses influence our movements the study involved measuring the power of ruth s swing his reaction time his attention his memory and his motor skills the results of this study offered a reason for why ruth hit so many home runs his skill for hitting home runs could be because on the tests his motor skills and reflexes scored above average the next development that came regarded football at stanford university b c graves a psychology graduate student walter miles a professor and glenn pop warner a college football coach started an experiment their experiment studied reaction time they ran their ran experiment so they could find the fastest way to get the offense to move together when the center hiked the ball this led to the use of psychology as a way to gain an advantage over your opponent in a competition even though there were many developments to this field prior to this point the most important did not come until the time of coleman griffith griffith was a professor at the university of illinois he is considered to be the father of sports psychology in north america griffith s first contribution was that he started a section in his introductory to psychology class that only athletes could take then in he gave the first public talk about psychology and athletics in he started a special course focusing on psychology and sports it was called psychology and athletics the textbook that was used for this class was griffith s third book called psychology of coaching later in griffith began meeting with knute rockne who was a football coach at notre dame he met with rockne to explore how coaching was affected by psychology the next major contribution that griffith made was in when he opened the first sports psychology lab in north america this lab was only able to stay open for six years after the closure of the laboratory griffith was contacted in by philip wrigley wrigley was the owner of the major league baseball team the chicago cubs he contacted griffith to offer him a job griffith accepted the job he called the project experimental laboratories of the chicago national league ball club while with the cubs griffith studied how psychological factors influenced performance based on the results of his research griffith made recommendations to wrigley these recommendations included psychological clinics for the players holding fielding practice and having achievement tests to measure the athletes basic skills however wrigley did not follow these recommendations but was still impressed by griffith s work wrigley offered griffith a full time position as a sports psychologist in griffith refused the job to stay with his family after this griffith did not conduct anymore major research in the area of sports psychology griffith was an important part of sport psychology s history he was an important part because not only was he the first sports psychologist but he also opened the first laboratory in america that studied the relationship between sports and psychology in the s and s psychology was beginning to be taught at coaching schools some coaches used what they were learning about sports psychology while coaching their teams paul brown was head coach of the cincinnati bengals he began using psychological testing with his players his tests eventually became known as the beginning of the national football league s tests that are still used today during the s psychology was starting to be used as a way for athletes to improve their performance psychology professor dorothy hazeltine yates helped a boxer try to improve his skills through psychology the boxer then went on to have the best fights of his career also during the s hypnosis was starting to be used to help athletes to relax during the s david f tracy began using psychological methods to help players on the st louis browns a major league baseball team now known as the baltimore orioles in the late s and early s sports were becoming more important to people so psychology of sports was more accepted because it helped athletes four things were important to expand the field of sports psychology these were textbooks graduate programs associations and journals one of the main areas that was being studied during this time period was the affect stress had on athletes and their performance in warren r johnson continued the research he started in this research was about the effect stress had on an athlete he continued this research by creating the first textbook on the topic in maxwell howell started the first graduate school program in physical education he did this at the university of alberta in canada the creation of associations and journals was the next development of this time period in the north american society for the psychology of sport and physical activity or naspspa was created it was created by a group of sport psychologists led by warren johnson one of the first things that this organization did was to start publishing the sport psychology bulletin the sport psychology bulletin included research reports and the writings of the members of the naspspa then in the international journal of sport psychology was started during the s and s there were many associations and journals that were started these were the association for the advancement of applied sport psychology the american psychological association s division of exercise and sport psychology the sport psychology academy of the american alliance for health physical education recreation and dance the journal of sports psychology the journal of sport science the sport psychologist and the journal of applied sport psychology the next major developments involved the united states olympic committee in they started a sports medicine council that included sports psychologists in they created the first registry or list of sports psychologists now there are two types of sports psychology academic and applied academic sports psychology does the research applied sports psychology uses that research to teach coaches and trainers there are three main areas of need in applied sports psychology they are what kinds of certification education or licenses are necessary to practice applied sports psychology the need to provide proper training for people who are studying applied sports psychology and developing new ways to help athletes today the number of sports psychologists that are being used by athletes is increasing in fact so many athletes are being helped by sports psychologists that some organizations are starting to limit how many coaches can be on the field during a game many athletes are now using sports psychology as part of their everyday lives and training for games", " a standardized test is a test that is done and scored in a consistent or standard manner standardized tests are designed so that everything about them are standard they are administered and scored in a predetermined standard manner often they are used as a test to join an institution or gain a license of some sort the grading system is the same no matter where they are taken they can be used for university entry like the sat and act in the united states or the gaokao in the people s republic of china prc they can be used a requirement to get a job like the lsat for lawyers in the united states the term is often used for the multiple choice questions used in the educational system they are thought by some to be a poor way to measure educational progress they are however convenient and cheap marking does not require expertise in the subject matter many psychological tests are designed to be standardized they are designed to be an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior the first known standardized test was in imperial china when empress wu allowed anyone who passed the test to be a government official based on their merit rather than birthright meaning that people work to become leaders rather than being born into leadership however we do not know the details of this system", " the stanford prison experiment spe was a psychology experiment to see the effects of becoming a prisoner or a prison guard on human behaviour and psychology the experiment ran from august led by dr philip zimbardo at stanford university in the experiment student volunteers were assigned to be either a guard or a prisoner in a fake prison at the flip of a coin and zimbardo was the prison superintendent they were paid a day the experiment was intended to run for weeks but some of the guards quickly became authoritarian and began psychologically torturing the prisoners and the experiment had to be stopped after only days prisoners left the experiment early after having severe psychological stress zimbardo concluded that certain situations can cause good people to behave in a way that they normally would not have predicted the stanford prison experiment is used in many introductory psychology textbooks to show the impact of power and authority on human behaviour the experiment is controversial for a few reasons demand characteristics which causes the participants to behave in the way they think the researcher wants them to behave there are other ethical issues with the spe and zimbardo has been criticised for interpreting the results to fit his previous expectations the experiment also had certain problems zimbardo and his colleagues made an advert in the palo alto city newspaper for a study of the psychological effects of prison life on college students the participants were to be paid a day they did psychological tests and interviews to make sure that the participants were psychologically healthy with no history of crime or drug abuse or any medical disabilities the participants were randomly assigned to either be a guard or a prisoner based on a coin flip they made the fake prison in the basement of the stanford psychology department building there was a closet which they called the hole which served as solitary confinement there were no windows or clocks which meant the prisoners had time altering experiences three prisoners were in each of the three cells offices the prisoners were arrested and held in the detention cells of the palo alto police department then escorted to the stanford county jail upon arrival they were stripped naked deloused and given a uniform the uniform was a dress with no underclothes a chain around their ankle stocking caps to mimic a prisoner s shaved head and they were each assigned a prison number which became their new name the guards had a uniform of khaki a baton reflective sunglasses to make them more anonymous and a whistle around their neck the guards worked on eight hour shifts with three guards working at any one time the prisoners had to perform counts several times a day and night where they had to call their prison number out loud to enforce the feeling of authority from the guards the experiment was intended to run for two weeks but after days had to be abandoned because the guards became more abusive towards the prisoners the spe has been criticised for having strong demand characteristics which is where participants act the way they think the researchers want them to act in an experiment to test the extent of the demand characteristics in the spe banauzzi and mohavedi asked students to predict the results of the spe and predicted that the guards would act in an oppressive hostile nature towards the prisoners so the participants in the experiment could also have predicted how they were supposed to act and act in this way to please the researchers  in his book the lucifer effect zimbardo explained that he told the participants how they were supposed to behave we can create boredom we can create a sense of frustration we can create fear in them to some degree we can create a notion of the arbitrariness that governs their lives which are totally controlled by us by the system by you me they ll have no privacy at all there will be constant surveillance nothing they do will go unobserved they will have no freedom of action they will be able to do nothing and say nothing that we don t permit we re going to take away their individuality in various ways in general what all this should create in them is a sense of powerlessness we have total power in the situation they have none pp the fact that zimbardo was both the head researcher and the prison superintendent added to the demand characteristics because the guards wanted to please the superintendent and the overlap between the superintendent and the head psychologist means the participants would have have followed demand characteristics more strongly peter gray publicly stated why he hasn t included the spe in his introductory psychology textbooks explaining that by remaining silent when the guards abused the prisoners zimbardo was approving of their methods of intimidation and the guards who were less assertive were instructed to be tougher for example warden jaffe one of zimbardo s student research associates said to one of the nicer guards the guards have to know that every guard has to be what we call a tough guard the success of this experiment rides on the behavior of the guards to make it seem as realistic as possible pp there was direct instruction to behave more assertively and approval of the behaviour of the tough guards about a third of the guards became sadistic authoritarian guards of the guards acted in a humane way which critics argue goes against zimbardo s interpretation of the results that good people can turn evil in the right environment there has been a lot of interest for the events in the media at least the following movies were made", " stevens power law is a proposed relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel most people think that it describes a wider range of sensations than weber fechner law but critics argue that the validity of the law is not sure the theory is named after psychophysicist stanley smith stevens although the idea of a power law had been suggested by th century researchers stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in the general form of the law is where i displaystyle i is the magnitude of the physical stimulus displaystyle psi is the psychophysical function capturing sensation the subjective size of the stimulus a displaystyle a is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation and k displaystyle k is a proportionality constant that depends on the type of stimulation and the units used the table to the right lists the exponents reported by stevens", " a stimulus in psychology is an energy change such as light or sound which is received by the senses the usage changes somewhat according to which school of psychology is using it a stimulus or stimuli might be used to see if a person is in a coma and what type of coma", " stockholm syndrome is something that sometimes happens to people who are victims of kidnapping in stockholm syndrome the victim starts feeling loyalty toward the person who kidnapped him or her and even start to have feelings for the person it got its name from a bank robbery in norrmalmstorg in stockholm sweden in there was a bank robbery where two thieves held four people as hostages after the thieves were arrested the hostages defended them publicly", " stream of consciousness refers to the flow of thoughts in the conscious mind it was a term used by the american psychologist and philosopher william james in james said the idea but not the term had been noted before james by the philosopher william hamilton in his lectures of he described thought as a series of acts all connected a similar idea occurs in early buddhist writings and is sometimes called the mindstream", " subliminal stimuli are sensations just below the threshold of a person s conscious perception they may be designed to influence the mental processes or the behavior of the individual without beiing noticed a recent review of functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri studies shows that subliminal stimuli activate certain parts of the brain but the subjects do not notice the stimulus visual stimuli may be quickly flashed before an individual can process them or flashed and then masked thereby interrupting the processing audio stimuli may be played below audible volumes or masked by other stimuli", " superiority bias is when people think too much of themselves without good reason they overrate their positive qualities and abilities and underrate their negative qualities relative to others other phrases for this are illusory superiority the above average effect leniency error sense of relative superiority the primus inter pares effect and the lake wobegon effect this was named after garrison keillor s fictional town where all the children are above average illusory superiority has been found in education such as class performance exams and overall intelligence at work for example in job performance and in social settings for example in estimating one s popularity or the extent to which one possesses desirable personality traits such as honesty or confidence as well as everyday abilities requiring particular skill one problem is the ambiguity of the word average it is logically possible for nearly all of the set to be above the mean if the distribution of abilities is highly skewed for example the mean number of human legs is slightly lower than two because of a small number of people have only one or no legs hence experiments usually compare subjects to the median of the peer group since by definition it is impossible for a majority to exceed the median a second problem is that people interpret a question in different ways so maybe most are better than the rest of the group each on their own understanding this interpretation is confirmed by experiments which varied the amount of interpretive freedom subjects were given as subjects evaluate themselves on a specific well defined attribute illusory superiority remains in kruger and dunning s experiments participants were given specific tasks such as solving problems in logic analyzing grammar questions and deciding whether or not jokes were funny they were asked to evaluate their performance on these tasks relative to the rest of the group this gave a direct comparison of their actual and perceived performance results were divided into four groups depending on actual performance and it was found that all four groups evaluated their performance as above average meaning that the lowest scoring group the bottom showed a very large illusory superiority bias the researchers attributed this to the fact that the individuals who were worst at performing the tasks were also worst at recognizing skill in those tasks this was supported by the fact that given training the worst subjects improved their estimate of their rank as well as getting better at the tasks in a survey of faculty at the university of nebraska rated themselves in the top for teaching ability in a similar survey of mba students at stanford university rated their academic performance as above the median findings of illusory superiority in research have also explained phenomena such as the large amount of stock market trading as each trader thinks they are the best and most likely to succeed and the number of lawsuits that go to trial because due to illusory superiority many lawyers have an inflated belief that they will win a case one of the first studies that found the effect of illusory superiority was carried out in by the college board in the usa a survey was attached to the sat exams taken by approximately one million students per year asking the students to rate themselves relative to the median of the sample rather than the average peer on a number of vague positive characteristics in ratings of leadership ability of the students put themselves above the median in ability to get on well with others put themselves above the median and rated themselves in the top research also showed subjects rated friends higher than other peers in zuckerman and jost s study participants were given detailed questionnaires about their friendships and asked to assess their own popularity they showed that the participants generally had exaggerated perceptions of their own popularity particularly in comparison to their own friends researchers have also found the effects of illusory superiority in studies into relationship satisfaction for example one study found that participants thought their own relationships were better than others relationships on average they also thought that most people were happy with their relationships this study found evidence that the higher the participants rated their own relationship happiness the more superior they believed their relationship was in men satisfaction was also related to the perception that one s own relationship was superior women s satisfaction was particularly related to the assumption that most others were happy with their relationship illusory superiority effects have been found in a study of health behaviors the study involved asking participants to estimate how often they and their peers carried out healthy and unhealthy behaviors participants reported that they carried out healthy behaviors more often than the average peer and unhealthy behaviors less often as would be expected given the effect of illusory superiority these findings were for both past self report of behaviors and expected future behaviors svenson surveyed students in sweden and the united states asking them to compare their driving safety and skill to the other people in the experiment for driving skill of the us sample and of the swedish sample put themselves in the top above the median for safety of the us group and of the swedish sample put themselves in the top mccormick walkey and green found similar results in their study asking participants to evaluate their position on eight different dimensions relating to driving skill examples include the dangerous safe dimension and the considerate inconsiderate dimension only a small minority rated themselves as below average the midpoint of the dimension scale at any point and when all eight dimensions were considered together it was found that almost of participants had evaluated themselves as being above the average driver subjects describe themselves in positive terms compared to other people and this includes describing themselves as less susceptible to bias than other people this effect is called the bias blind spot", " suspension of disbelief is the willingness for a person to accept fantasy as it is presented to them in any

argues that political equality does not require similarity but policies that treat people as individuals with rights that moral progress doesn t need the human mind to be naturally free of selfish actions only morals to counteract them are needed that responsibility doesn t need behavior to be uncaused only that it answers to praise and blame and that meaning in life doesn t the process that created the brain must have a purpose only that the brain itself must have purposes he also argues that grounding ideals in claims about a blank slate opens them to the possibility of being overturned by future discoveries he further states that a blank slate is in fact not in sequence with opposition to many social evils since a blank slate could be conditioned to enjoy slavery evolutionary and genetic inequality statements do not have to support right wing policies pinker writes that if everyone is equal regarding abilities it can be argued that it is only necessary to give everyone equal opportunity on the other hand if some people have less innate ability then redistribution policies should favor those with less innate ability further economics is built upon an assumption of an actor while evolutionary psychology suggests that people have many different goals and behaviors that do not fit the actor theory a rising tide lifts all boats is often used as an argument that inequality need not be reduced as long as there is growth evolutionary psychology suggests that low status itself apart from material considerations is highly stressful towards the brain and may cause dangerous behaviors which suggests that inequalities should be reduced finally evolutionary explanations may also help the left create policies with greater public support suggesting that people s sense of fairness caused by mechanisms such as reciprocal altruism rather than greed is a primary cause of opposition to welfare if there is not a distinction in the proposals between what is perceived as the deserving and the undeserving poor", " howard gardner is a professor at harvard university his idea is that people are not smart in only one way he says that we can be smart in many different ways", "

spirituality the most straightforward example is when a person is hypnotized they are in a trance conscious and responding to the hypnotist the person seems to block out other thoughts and other

problem and other problems in her essay the problem of abortion and the doctrine of the double effect massachusetts institute of technology professor judith jarvis thomson made the trolley problem famous now many schools teach the trolley problem for a while there was even a part of philosophy called trolleyology jarvis thomson named the problem the trolley problem the trolley problem does not have a right or wrong answer instead it is a way to make people think and talk about what makes actions good or bad and why the player you is on a trolley a fast moving cart that can only run on a track it is not an automobile that can be driven off the edge of a road it must stay on a track ahead of the player five people are standing on the track where the trolley will run over them and kill them the player has no way to stop the trolley the only thing the player can do is throw a switch to make the trolley change onto a different track on this second track there is one person none of the six people have time to move out of the way in jarvis thomson s version the person controlling the trolley switch is not on the trolley instead this player is watching from the side this person can throw the switch but they can also choose to do nothing if the player does nothing the trolley will kill five people if the player throws the switch the trolley will kill one person there are different versions of the trolley problem what if the player knows something about the individual people on the track the player is a doctor working in an emergency room a homeless person or traveler comes to the emergency room but the doctor learns he is not sick at all upstairs in the hospital there are five sick people who need organ transplants the homeless person is a perfect match for all five like in the trolley problem the doctor can kill one person by taking action or allow five people to die by doing nothing the emergency room case was also in foot s essay most people think the emergency room problem is different from the trolley problem even though the numbers are the same the trolley problem is something that could happen in real life but would be very rare healthy people going to emergency rooms every day in the emergency room problem many many things can affect the player s decision the students say things like the player is a doctor and doctors are taught not to hurt or kill people so the player will say no instead of saying what they themselves would do or they would say things like if the doctors kill the homeless person people will find out about it they will be worried that the doctors will kill them for their organs so they will not go to the emergency room when they need to then more than five people will die sick people who did not go to the emergency room for help these things are true but they mean the emergency room case is very complicated for a thought experiment philosophers invented the footbridge problem as a better version of the emergency room problem unlike in the emergency room problem there are no societal systems that get in the way for example the doctor s education or people deciding not to go to the emergency room in the footbridge problem the player is standing on a small bridge over a trolley track again there is a trolley with no brakes heading very fast toward five people it will hit and kill the people if nothing stops it they cannot get out of the way there is also a second person on the footbridge if the player pushes this one person off the footbridge then their body will stop the trolley saving the five other people but the one person whom the player has pushed will die in this problem the person the player would push is big and fat enough to stop the trolley but the player is not other variations on the trolley problem include when the player knows some or all of the people on the tracks another is when the big fat person on the footbridge put the five people on the track on purpose so they would be run over another is when the one person whom the trolley can run over instead of the other five is a person taking a nap in a hammock instead of someone standing on a trolley track a team of scientists led by joshua greene put people in an fmri machine to watch what their brains did while they thought about the trolley problem and its other versions when people thought about pulling the trolley switch to kill one person instead of five the parts of the brain that do cool rational thinking the prefrontal cortex lit up when people thought about pushing a fat man onto the track the parts of their brain that do emotion the amygdala lit up the people decided not to push the fat man onto the track greene and the other scientists said they think human beings are more likely to make moral decisions using intuition when they are feeling emotions for example the disgust they feel at the thought of killing an innocent fat man green and the other scientists said they think human beings are more likely to make decisions using logic when their emotions are not involved the trolley problem appeared in the episode the trolley problem on the second season of the sitcom

magnitude of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel in one of his classic experiments weber gradually increased the weight that a blindfolded man was holding and asked him to respond when he first felt the increase weber found that the response was proportional to a relative increase in the weight that is to say if the weight is kg an increase of a few grams will not be noticed rather when the mass is increased by a certain factor an increase in weight is perceived if the mass is doubled the threshold is also doubled the relationship between stimulus and perception is logarithmic this logarithmic relationship means that if a stimulus varies as a geometric progression i e multiplied by a fixed factor the corresponding perception is altered in an arithmetic progression i e in additive constant amounts for example if a stimulus is tripled in strength i e x the corresponding perception may be two times as strong as its original value i e if the stimulus is again tripled in strength i e x x the corresponding perception will be three times as strong as its original value i e hence for multiplications in stimulus strength the strength of perception only adds this logarithmic relationship is valid not just for the sensation of weight but for other stimuli and our sensory perceptions as well", " "]}, {"name": "Sociology", "articles": [" sociology is

be done under the banner of science the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty the way in which media attention works can be exploited to produce ignorance other factors that influence it are that corporations or governments do not reveal certain facts at times they force these facts to be removed if they have been revealed the methods they use include censorship destroying documents putting the weight of certain facts differently or being inattentive or forgetful agnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do

person s feelings it signals interest in the other person and in the conversation relaxed posture comfortably seated relaxed breathing no visible stiffness or abrupt movements these indicate no major barriers to communication arms relaxed uncrossed arms and hands open palms up or otherwise visible to the other person are signs of openness good eye contact looking in the other person s eyes particularly when they are speaking indicates interest in that person proper eye contact involves looking away occasionally to avoid staring nodding agreement when nods are used to punctuate key things the other person has said they signal agreement interest and understanding however continual unconscious bobbing of the head usually indicates that the listener is tuning out taking notes shows interest and involvement particularly if notes are on what the other person is saying smiling adding humour this is a very positive sign it signals a warm personal relationship leaning closer reducing the distance between two people particularly when the other person is speaking indicates interest is up and barriers are down gesturing warmly talking with hands particularly with palms open indicates involvement in the conversation and openness to the other person for all of these positive gestures moderation is the rule when they are exaggerated they can become more negative than positive negative body language is somewhat less reliable as an indicator of the person s comfort with the current conversation than positive body language actions that are generally considered negative may just be a matter of comfort for this person may indicate that the person is tired or may result from other matters that are weighing on this person s mind body tense stiffness wrinkled brow jerky body motion hands clasped in front or palms down on the table these can indicate concern with the topic or dealing with the other person arms folded in front creates a barrier can express resistance to

health care administrative and service roles such as program planning day to day operations service monitoring media liaison budgeting policy development programs management for health promotion and disease prevention and advocate to overcome or make availability accessibility of certain healthcare services a medical social worker in healthcare management works toward systems transformation through coalitions with various departments and in hospital operations at every stage in life health is determined by complex interactions between social and economic factors the physical environment and behavior they do not exist in isolation from each other the wider the income gap within a society the higher its mortality and morbidity rates it is studied that half of all healthcare outcomes are linked to the social determinants hence an actions taken by a social worker to reduce health inequalities will also have economic benefits following are the functions of a medical social worker medical social workers help the patient s and their families to manage life crises due to acute or chronic medical conditions and focus on improving their mental and physical well being which is done by counseling needs assessment and psychosocial assessments which involves a thinking process that seeks out the meaning of case situations puts the particulars of the case in some order and leads to appropriate interventions hospital services health care management as an executive to care coordinator or administrator is a critical role for a medical social worker administrative responsibilities entail to ensure efficient and effective unit operation contributing to staff development by promoting and ensuring a supportive collaborative learning environment based on the principles of adult

clinic processes psychosocial interventions with non clinical hospital operations administrative support case coordination health information management employee health safety and security supply chain management human resources etc is a key distinction of a medical social worker patient counseling is an important part of the medical social worker s role medical social workers lead support group discussions provide individual counseling help patients determine appropriate health care and other health services and provide support to patients with serious or chronic illnesses medical social workers also work in health and safety aspects of a hospital setting there contributions lead to reduced hospital acquired infection hai the social worker attempts to makes changes in poor workplace conditions e g overworked staff time pressures lack of safety protocols or lack of appropriate supervision as well as poor individual conditions e g fatigue stress or illness to reduce medical errors a study conducted by dawson reid in found that health care professionals that are being awake hours was equivalent to having a blood alcohol level of legally intoxicated by most standards a self assessment that qualifies fitness of health care professional to attend patient care was developed thereafter it is im safe it basically asks questions to self whether the professional is suffering any illness taking medications stress management using alcohol fatigue eating timely another prime objective of a medical social worker is assisting patients along with staff members to cope with psychosocial problems associated with ill health and thus promote the overall wellness of theirs in the hospital setting medical social workers play an important role in coordinating patient discharge planning and after care services following the physician s notification that the patient is ready for discharge there are a number of factors that influence the timing of discharge in private community hospitals it can be costly to allow patients to remain inpatient when it is no longer medically necessary discharge delays can prove costly to the hospital and to the patient depending on the patient s funding source social workers also assist patients and families access in home health care services arrange for in home medical equipment provide for transportation coordinate follow up treatments and refer patients to a wide variety of community social service agencies medical social workers are often also responsible for helping patients access financial assistance and health insurance coverage in some settings medical social workers work closely with public and private health insurers to determine the patient s benefits and advocate for the patient another skill required of medical social workers is the ability to work cooperatively with other members of the multidisciplinary treatment team who are directly involved in the patient s care it is also the responsibility of the medical social worker to manage any dispute in the multidisciplinary team medical social workers also need to have good analytical and excellent assessment skills an ability to communicate the medical language physiology of the disease and the types of treatment offered with both patients and the family is necessary and an ability to quickly and effectively establish a therapeutic relationship with patients but of paramount importance medical social workers must be willing to act as advocates for the patients especially in situations where the medical social worker has identified problems that may compromise the well being of patient or in any distress in the discharge process that might put the patient at risk an understanding between advocacy and collaboration loyalty to the patient and the institution is important for a hospital social worker for example a medical provider may report that a frail elderly patient who lives alone is medically stable for discharge and plans to discharge the patient home with in home services after assessing the patient s psychosocial needs the medical social worker determines that the patient does not have the ability to manage at home safely even with the intervention of a home care worker the medical social worker informs the medical provider that the proposed discharge plan may place the patient at risk and the discharge plan is deferred pending further assessment the medical social worker can then collaborate with multidisciplinary providers to develop a more appropriate discharge plan even if that leads to discharge delays medical social workers value the ethical concept of patient autonomy and self determination although this value can conflict with the values and ethics of other disciplines in a medical setting medical social workers strive to preserve the patient s right to make his or her own decisions about goals of care treatment planning discharge etc as long as the patient is capable of making those decisions him herself patients often make decisions that medical professionals disagree with but the medical social worker advocates for the patient s right to self determination if the patient is not able to make his her own decisions based on a cognitive or other impairment the right of self determination can be superseded by concern that a patient is a risk to self or others as medical social workers often have large case loads and have to meet tight deadlines for arranging necessary services medical social work is a demanding job that is vulnerable to detrimental impact often this job requires tolerance due to its lackluster reality of unsupportive and hostile environment and cross departmental nature with nursing and public relations which diminishes the visibility authority gradient of the profession within an institution the inadequate salary and restrained professional growth is also a major concern for medical social workers medical social workers often deal with complex cases involving patients who come into the hospital with multiple psycho social issues all of which require assessment and treatment it is not uncommon for medical social workers to tackle cases involving homelessness chronic unemployment lack of income lack of health insurance coverage history of incarceration and substance abuse problems any of these problems separately and together can impede timely care services sometimes situations as seemingly ordinary as the patient needing bus fare or a decent pair of shoes can lead to delays in discharge which could incur social and healthcare costs especially if these needs are not identified quickly and early a poor or non existent relationship between assessment and interventions due to lack of structured communication sbar situation background assessment and recommendation policies economic restraints could also cause this this is why a complete and timely assessment of the patient s psychosocial needs are critical for empowering and recovery by a medical social worker with a repertoire of management assessment and treatment skills who is adept in functioning within the hospital s continuum atmosphere of change and shifting priorities is required ", " sociobiology is a field of scientific study which is based on the assumption that social behaviour has resulted from evolution it attempts to explain and examine social behaviour in that way a branch of ethology and sociology sociobiology draws from anthropology evolution zoology archaeology population genetics and other disciplines as a study of human societies sociobiology is allied to darwinian anthropology ethology and evolutionary psychology ethology investigates collective animal behaviour such as mating patterns territorial fights pack hunting and the hive society of social insects it argues that selection pressure led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behaviour in other words a typical behaviour pattern is inherited because it has raised the inclusive fitness of individuals as compared to other behaviours this is mainstream biology its extension into human social behaviour is for ethologists absolutely normal but for others it may be controversial while the term sociobiology can be traced to the s the concept did not get recognition until with the publication of e o wilson s book sociobiology sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises it is this last point which is most controversial wilson s book had almost pages which were almost entirely devoted to social behaviour in animals his ideas on the evolution of human behaviour was in a short section of pages at the end of the book yet because of this section the apparently new field of sociobiology became the subject of heated controversy the criticism was driven by political events of the day criticism by richard lewontin and stephen jay gould and the sociobiology study group hinted that there was some relationship between these ideas and some of the worst events in history the main concern of the critics seemed to be the idea that sociobiology provided aid and comfort for those who would maintain social injustice and inequality p actually there was no political content in wilson s last chapter and wilson himself was and is a liberal thinker in the th anniversary edition of his book wilson gives his own account of the controversy to avoid some of the controversy though their ideas are rather similar to wilson s some psychologists and anthropologists founded the related field of evolutionary psychology this shares with sociobiology a belief in the evolutionary origin of behaviour patterns however it is more aimed at human behaviour where sociobiology arose out of experiments on animal behaviour ethology why do men have standards of beauty which they apply to women this is a question to which a typical femininist sociologist would reply it is culturally determined a belief system which serves to keep males dominant over females to this john alcock asks what are the actual data are the standards of beauty in western culture arbitrary the standards of beauty are consistent with youth and good health young healthy women are more likely to become pregnant and give birth successfully than older or unhealthy women alcock asks alcock gives the evidence that the signs of youth and beauty are consistent with high reproductive value p in some ways it is easier to study the behaviour of other animals because our own experiences and prejudices are not involved and we can do experiments on them which might not be possible with humans songbird species almost always have a song which is characteristic of the species in most cases the details of the song are not inherited instead they inherit an ability to learn at a certain age if a young male white crowned sparrow zonotrichia leucophrys is raised in isolation from the sound of other members of the species it cannot sing their song eventually it produces a song which is only vaguely like the proper song but if the experimenter plays a tape of the adult male song the young will later produce the complete and perfect song when they get to the right age however if the young bird is made deaf it cannot learn the song from this we learn this allows us to be sure that the song as such is not inherited but there is inherited a strong learning bias which makes sense in order to live and reproduce successfully it pays for a male to attract a female of the same species and defend its territory against other males of its species the right song does both these jobs p in recent years the supporters of sociobiology have claimed to be winning they feel its basic ideas are quite sound we are not blank slates and our human nature is as much a product of evolution as the rest of us even our widespread love of pet animals may be explained by their improving our survival in a prehistoric past p", " the sociological imagination is seeing the relationship between individual experiences and society american sociologist c wright mills made this term in his book the

" by linda bordoni on pentecost sunday pope francis invited the faithful to open their hearts to the holy spirit and go out in the world with courage hope and faith to witness to the love of the risen jesus christ addressing pilgrims gathered in st peter s square for the recitation of the regina coeli prayer the pope reflected on the book of the acts of the apostles that recounts what happened in jerusalem days after the pasch of jesus he recalled that the disciples were gathered in the upper room and the virgin mary was with them they had been told by risen lord to remain in the city until they received the gift of the spirit from on high this the pope said was revealed with a sound they suddenly heard come from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind that filled the house they were in it concerns he explained a real but also symbolic experience and it reveals that the holy spirit is like a strong and freely flowing wind he cannot be controlled stopped nor measured nor can his direction be foreseen the holy spirit pope francis continued cannot be understood within our human exigencies in our methods and our preconceptions the spirit proceeds from god the father and from his son jesus christ and bursts upon the church upon each one of us giving life to our minds and our hearts as the creed states he is the lord the giver of life the pope went on to explain that on the day of pentecost jesus disciples were still disoriented and fearful and lacked the courage to go out in the open we too at times prefer to remain within the protective walls of our surroundings but the lord knows how to reach us and open the doors to our hearts he sends upon us the holy spirit who envelops us and overpowers all our hesitations tears down our defences dismantles our false certainties the spirit makes us new creatures just as he did that day with the apostles he said and after having received the holy spirit the pope continued they were no longer as they were before but went out and began to preach that jesus is risen he is the lord in such a way that each one understood them in his or her own language the pope said that the spirit changed the heart and broadened the disciples view enabling them to communicate to everyone the great limitless works of god surpassing the cultural and religious confines within which they were accustomed to thinking and living the holy spirit puts different people in communication achieving the unity and universality of the church he said the pope concluded by inviting the faithful to open their hearts to the gift of the spirit which makes us feel all the beauty and truth of god s love in the dead and risen christ spurring us to go out to witness to this love that always precedes us with his mercy the world he said needs the courage hope and faith of the disciples of christ it needs us to become yeast leaven salt and light in different situations and in the many cultural and social contexts and the holy spirit alone creates all this the pope s agenda pope s activities our faith useful information other sites our channels"
